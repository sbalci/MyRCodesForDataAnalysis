AB  - BACKGROUND Burkitt leukemia (BL) with the precursor B-cell immunophenotype is a rarely reported condition. The prognosis of such patients is similar to that of classic BL. However, the combination of chromosomal translocations associated with bcl-2 and c-myc rearrangement has a poor prognosis. OBSERVATIONS: An 11-year-old child presented with fever and weakness. Bone marrow aspiration showed morphologically L1 type blasts and flow cytometry analysis was compatible with precursor B-cell immunophenotype. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a combination of t(8;14) and t(14;l8). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of t(8;14) and t(14;l8) can exhibit different immunophenotypical and morphologic features in leukemias.

AB  - Heterotopic tissue in the bile duct is a very rare condition. There are a few case reports of heterotopic tissue including gastric and pancreatic cells. However, we could not find any data regarding heterotopic chondroid tissue obstructing the common bile duct in the literature. A 56-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of progressive jaundice and pruritus. Laboratory test results were within the normal limits except bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase which were 10.8 mg/dL and 256 IU/L, respectively. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) and computed tomography (CT) revealed a biliary stricture confined to the upper part of the common bile duct. The patient was operated as soon as the bilirubin level dropped below 5 mg/dL by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. Despite the lack of a precise confirmation, the patient was prepared for operation considering the possibility of a malignant biliary tumor since the radiographic mass findings together with hyperbilirubinemia were highly suggestive of malignancy. The patient underwent total extrahepatic bile duct resection and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and was discharged without any postoperative complications. Histologic examination of the bile duct and the nodule revealed the presence of a well-demarcated chondroid tissue within the subepithelial connective tissue. Herein, we presented the first case, to our knowledge, of heterotopic chondroid tissue of the common bile duct in the literature. It is a benign condition that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of stricture and mass-forming lesions of the bile duct.

AB  - Introduction Differentiation between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from benign mimickers is a well-known problem in cytological materials. Recent studies incorporated biological markers into this question and some studies showed that expression of S100P, IMP3, and maspin as well as nonexpression of von Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) were significantly correlated with PDAC. In this study, we aimed to investigate diagnostic value of maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL immunostaining in fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) of pancreatic lesions. Materials and Method: In all, 33 cases of FNAB cell blocks of PDAC and 34 cases of surgical non-neoplastic pancreas specimens which were retrieved from the archives slides from 2007 to 2011 were included in this study. All the cases were stained with maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL. Expression patterns of markers were scored and compared with benign mimickers. Test performance of each antibody and possible antibody combinations were also evaluated. Results: The study was composed of 33 PDAC and 34 control cases (8 chronic pancreatitis, 3 mucinous cystic neoplasm, and 23 nontumoral pancreatic tissue of PDAC). Diagnostic sensitivity for malignancy in S100P, IMP3, and maspin was 84.8%, 81.8%, and 87.5%, respectively. Specificity of these three markers was 100%. Sensitivity and specificity of pVHL for detecting nontumoral pancreatic tissue were 100% and 81.8%, respectively. When maspin, IMP3, and S100P expression were used together as triple test, sensitivity was 62.5% and specificity 100%. However, when any two of each three markers were evaluated (triple test/dual response), sensitivity reached 93.8% and specificity 100%. Conclusion: We observed that dual response in triple test (positive staining with two of these three markers) of maspin, IMP3, and S100P immunocytochemistry is very sensitive and specific in differential diagnosis of PDA and non-neoplastic pancreatic lesions. pVHL may have an additional role, when triple assessment is not satisfactory.

AB  - Resveratrol, a phytochemical, acts several cellular signaling pathways and has anti-inflammatory potentials. The purpose of this study is to research the therapeutic effect of resveratrol in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in rats and whether resveratrol affects the activities of signaling pathways those are potent pathogenic actors of rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis was induced by intradermal injection of chicken type II collagen combined with incomplete Freund's adjuvant in Wistar albino rats. One day after the onset of arthritis (day 14), resveratrol (20 mg/kg/day) was given via oral gavage, until day 29. The paws of the rats were obtained for further analysis. Tissue Wnt5a, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Src tyrosine kinase and signal transducer, and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) mRNA expressions were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Resveratrol ameliorated the clinical and histopathological (perisynovial inflammation and cartilage-bone destruction) findings of inflammatory arthritis. The tissue mRNA expressions of Wnt5a, MAPK3, Src kinase, and STAT3 were increased in the sham group compared to the control group. Resveratrol supplement decreased their expressions. The present study shows that Src kinase, STAT3, and Wnt signaling pathway are active in the CIA model. Resveratrol inhibits these signaling pathways and ameliorates inflammatory arthritis.

AB  - Ewing's family of tumors is aggressive tumors and frequently arises from bone and soft tissue. They might also arise from nonosseous structures such as gastrointestinal tract, adrenal glands, or kidney. Primary renal Ewing's sarcoma (ES)/primitive neuroectodermal tumor is an extremely rare entity which has aggressive clinical course. These high-grade malignant tumors predominantly affect adolescents and young adults. Patients mostly present with nonspecific symptoms such as pain, hematuria, mass, and sensitivity. It is confused with renal cell cancer in imaging techniques. The definitive diagnosis is based on the histopathological examination. Surgical or radiotherapy treatment is used for local control and multiagent chemotherapy used for systemic treatment. Despite all treatment options, prognosis is poor. We aimed to describe the diagnosis and follow-up and treatment of renal ES case that was considered as renal cell carcinoma in imaging but diagnosed as ES via histopathology.

AB  - Introduction Increased levels of endoglin may represent a new reagent of active neovascularization and angiogenesis process in various cancer types. The prognostic value of tumor CD105 (endoglin) expression in cervical squamous cell cancer (CSCC) patients treated with radical radiotherapy (RT) +/- chemotherapy was investigated. Materials and Methods: CD105 (endoglin) expression was assessed by immunohistochemical methods in seventy patients, who were treated with radical RT +/- chemotherapy for CSCC. The prognostic effects of CD105 on patient and treatment characteristics, local-regional control, and survival were assessed. Results: The median follow-up was 24 (5-99) months for the whole cohort. The median CD105 microvessel density was 55.5 (range; 12-136). Age (</=61 vs. >61 years; P = 0.015), lymph node metastasis status (absent vs. present; P = 0.028), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (Ib-IIa vs. IIb-IVa; P = 0.036), cycles of concurrent chemotherapy (1-3 vs. 4-6 cycles; P = 0.001), and hemoglobin levels (</=10 g/dL vs. >10 g/dL; P = 0.006) appeared to associate significantly with overall survival on univariate analysis. Discussion: No correlation was identified between the tumor CD105 (endoglin) expression and survival in CSCC patients treated with radical RT +/- chemotherapy.

AB  - Aim Cytological detection of peritoneal-free gastric cancer cells is considered as the gold standard with variable sensitivity. Seeding of cancer cells after radical surgery for gastric cancer is a controversial issue. In this study, it was aimed to detect the rate of positive peritoneal washing cytology and the incidence of spreading of tumor cells after radical surgery. Materials and Methods: Patients with pathologically proven and surgically treated gastric adenocarcinoma were enrolled. Three peritoneal washing samples were examined cytologically: at the beginning, after completion of resection, and before closure of the abdomen. Identification of peritoneal-free gastric cancer cells was regarded as the main outcome. Results: Thirty-four patients with a mean age of 60.7 +/- 12 years were enrolled. T3 and N0 were the most common stages seen in 16 (47%) and 12 patients (35.3%), respectively. There were two positive results (5.9%) as the first peritoneal sample. Considering T3- or N-positive patients, the incidence increased to 9.1%. There was no conversion of negative to positive cytology. Cytological positivity remained only in one case (2.9%) after the second and the third peritoneal samples. Conclusion: Rate of positive peritoneal washing cytology in patients with gastric cancer is influenced by clinicopathological findings and the technique used. Use of cytology alone is thought to be failed to detect free cancers cells within the peritoneal cavity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing which can be attributed in part to improved ultrasonography (US) methods and increased detection of incidental thyroid carcinomas (ITC). We aimed to compare ITC with nonincidental thyroid carcinomas (NITC) in this study. METHODS: Retrospective analyses of 906 individual patients who were operated for benign and malignant thyroid disease and had a final histopathological diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma were enrolled in this study. Preoperative US examination and fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy results were evaluated. The tumor foci in thyroidectomy specimens that were not represented in preoperative US or FNA reports were classified as ITC. The tumor foci that match with the lesions defined in US or FNA results were classified as NITC. RESULTS: Final histology revealed ITC in 326 patients (36%) and NITC in 580 patients (64% Mean age was 51.7 +/- 11.11 in ITC group and 48.15 +/- 13.1 in NITC group (P < .001). In NITC group 322 (55.5%) of the patients were operated for suspicious cytology while only 29 (8.9%) of the patients in the ITC group were operated because of this indication (P < .001). There were 1301 cancer foci in histopathology specimens. Among all these cancer foci, 434 (33.3%) were detected incidentally and 867 (66.7%) were detected non-incidentally. About 779 (89.9%) of nonincidental cancer foci were papillary cancer (PTC), while all of the incidental cancer foci were PTC. Mean size was 13 mm in NITC group and it was 3 mm in the ITC group and differed significantly between the groups (P < .001). Tumor size was </=1 cm in 35.2% of the patients with NITC while 98.5% of patients with ITC had tumor </=1 cm. The occurrence of multinodularity was higher in ITC than the NITC group (P < 001). Median TSH level was higher in patients with NITC than ITC while both were in the reference range (1.53 vs 1.03 muIU/mL, P < .001). The frequency of thyroiditis detected by US, and thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin antibody positivities were similar in patients with ITC and NITC (P = .2, P = .86, and P = .26, respectively). The frequencies of capsular invasion (29.1% vs 7.9%), extrathyroidal extension (13% vs 4.2%), multifocality (35.8% vs 24.2%), non-complete resection (9.2% vs 1.8%), and lymph node metastasis (9.5% vs 1.8%) were significantly higher in the NITC group (P < .001, for each). Persistent/recurrent disease in patients with NITC was more frequent than patients with ITC (P = .004). This outcome was similar for cancers measuring </=1 cm (P = .001). CONCLUSION: ITC is often encountered in older patients and frequently determined in early stages with more favorable histopathological features and better prognosis.

AB  - PURPOSE Allergic rhinitis is an immunoglobulin-E (Ig-E)-mediated response driven by type 2 helper T cells. Hesperidin and thymol are biological agents that possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of hesperidin and thymol in rats with ovalbumin-induced allergic rhinitis. METHODS: Thirty adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into five groups, each containing six animals. The first group constituted the negative control group, while the remaining groups were exposed to an ovalbumin-induced model of allergic rhinitis. In the provocation stage, 4 mL/kg saline was administered to the positive control group, 10 mg/kg desloratadine to the reference group, 100 mg/kg hesperidin to the hesperidin group, and 20 mg/kg thymol to the thymol group, all by gastric lavage for 7 days. Nasal symptoms were scored on day 22. Rats were then sacrificed, and intracardiac blood specimens were collected to measure plasma total Ig-E, IL-5, IL-13, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS) levels. Nasal tissues were extracted for histopathological and immunochemical examination. RESULTS: Nasal symptom scores were highest in the positive control group, while hesperidin and thymol ameliorated these symptoms to the same extent as desloratadine. Ig-E, IL-5, IL-13, and TOS levels increased, while TAC levels decreased significantly in the allergic rhinitis group compared to the other groups. Significant improvement in these parameters was observed in both the hesperidin and thymol groups. At histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the nasal cavity, severe allergic inflammation and severe TNF-alpha expression was determined in rats from the allergic rhinitis group. Mild inflammatory changes and mild TNF-alpha expression were observed in all three treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Both hesperidin and thymol were effective in suppressing allergic symptoms and inflammation in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

AB  - AIM To assess blooming artifacts caused by root canal sealers in CBCT images compared with those that appeared in micro-CT scan images used as references. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Thirty freshly extracted human mandibular central incisors were used. Root canals were prepared with nickel titanium files with an ISO size 40/0.06 taper and filled with a single cone (40/0.06 taper) and three different sealers. The samples were divided into the following three groups with 10 roots each: (I) AH Plus sealer; (II) Sure Seal Root; and (III) Total BC sealer. Teeth were scanned with the same voxel sizes (0.2 mm) in different CBCT devices and the micro-CT images were acquired as reference images. RESULTS: Significantly different results in terms of blooming artifacts were detected between CBCT and micro-CT images, as well as among the CBCTs images. The canals filled with AH Plus sealer showed more blooming artifacts than those filled with bioceramic sealers (p < 0.05). Additionally, the worst blooming artifact was observed when the images were acquired with lower kilovoltage peak. CONCLUSION: The appearance of blooming artifacts is dependent on sealer and CBCT, and their effects are significantly worse than they are in micro-CT images. The differential effect of different sealers and distinct CBCT protocols should be further investigated to enable the use of bioceramic sealers without a significant impact on post-treatment imaging. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Root canal sealers showed a different extent of blooming artifact in CBCT images. Hence, researchers and clinicians should be aware of these artifacts before conducting endodontic evaluations using CBCT images.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the factors to predict Gleason score upgrading (GSU) of patients with prostate cancer who were evaluated by using the International Society for Urological Pathology (ISUP) 2014 Gleason grading system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2015, we retrospectively investigated patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy and followed up in the uro-oncology outpatient clinic. The pathologic specimens of the patients were evaluated based on the ISUP 2014 classification system. The patients were divided into two groups with or without upgraded Gleason scores. Factors that could be effective in predicting upgrading such as age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, D'Amico risk classification, PSA density, cancer of the prostate risk assessment (CAPRA) scores, biopsy tumor percentage, body mass index, and clinical stage parameters were compared between both groups. RESULTS: Of the 265 patients who could be evaluated and followed up regularly, Gleason score upgrades were observed in 110 (41.5%) patients. Advanced age (p=0.009), PSA >20 ng/mL (p=0.036), PSA density >0.35 (p=0.005), high CAPRA score (p=0.031), and high biopsy tumor percentage (p=0.009) were discovered to be correlated with Gleason score upgrade in univariate logistic regression analysis. Advanced age alone was a predictor for GSU in multivariate logistic regression analysis (p=0.002). Five-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 86% in the non-GSU group and 55% in the GSU group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: GSU risk should be taken into consideration in making therapeutic decisions for older patients with prostate cancer, and precautions should be taken against development of aggressive disease.

AB  - AIM In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of krill oil (KO) against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury on rat ovary. METHODS: This study was conducted with 32 Wistar Albino rats. Rats were divided into four groups, with eight rats in each group-as follows: Sham group, I/R group, I/R + low dose KO group (50 mg) and I/R + high dose KO group (500 mg). The histopathological and follicle counts were performed on the right ovary. The total antioxidant status, total oxidant status and oxidative stress index were evaluated on the left ovary. And also serum N-thiol level, serum T-thiol level, serum disulfide (SDS) level, serum disulfide/N-thiol and serum disulfide/T-thiol ratios were evaluated too. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was determined between the I/R group and all the other groups for all parameters. There was significant difference between KO groups and the Sham group for the parameters of serum N-thiol, serum T-thiol, SDS, serum disulfide/N-thiol and serum disulfide/T-thiol. SDS, total oxidant status and oxidative stress index were determined to be the highest in the I/R group and the lowest in the low dose KO group. The total antioxidant status values were found to be the highest in the high dose KO group and the lowest in the I/R group. Follicle counts and histological injury scores showed no significant difference between Sham and KO groups. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that KO has beneficial effects on decreasing the injury after I/R on rat ovary.

AB  - Glutathione (GSH) and enzymes related to this antioxidant molecule are often overexpressed in tumor cells and may contribute to drug resistance. Blockade of glutathione transferases (GSTs) has been proposed to potentiate the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of chlorophyllin that has antioxidant properties, and also interferes with the activity of GST P1-1, on breast cancers in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo studies were conducted using an N-methyl- N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced chemical carcinogenesis model in laboratory rats. DNA damage, GST activity, and GSH levels were determined in liver and tumor tissues. Treatment with chlorophyllin increased the GSH levels in the liver and significantly decreased DNA damage in the blood, liver, and tumor tissues. Even though tumorigenesis was delayed in rats receiving chlorophyllin before MNU injections, once the tumors emerged, the progression of tumor appeared to be faster than in the animals that received the carcinogen only. Out of nine breast cell lines, GST P1-1 expression was detected in MCF-12A, MDA-MB-231, and HCC38. Concomitant incubation with chlorophyllin and docetaxel did not significantly affect cell proliferation and viability. Chlorophyllin displayed genoprotective effects that initially delayed tumorigenesis. However, once the tumors were established, it may act as a promoter that facilitates tumor growth, potentially by a mechanism independent of cell proliferation and viability. Our results underline the pros and cons of antioxidant treatment in cancer, even if it has a capacity to inhibit GST P1-1.

AB  - BACKGROUND The American Thyroid Association (ATA) Management Guidelines for Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) are highly influential practice recommendations. The latest revision appeared in 2015 ("ATA 2015"). These guidelines were developed predominantly by North American experts. European experts frequently have different perspectives, given epidemiological, technological/methodological, practice organization, and medicolegal differences between the respective regions. SUMMARY: Divergent viewpoints were the focus of an invited symposium organized by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine involving 17 European thyroidologists, 4 ATA Guidelines Taskforce members, and an audience of 200 international experts. The group discussed "preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules," "surgery and role of pathology," "radioiodine therapy (RAIT)," "assessment of initial therapy and dynamic risk stratification," and "treatment of persistent disease, recurrences, and advanced thyroid cancer." The dialogue resulted in this position paper contrasting European and ATA 2015 perspectives on key issues. One difference pertains to ATA 2015's permissiveness of lobectomy for primary tumors </=4 cm. European panelists cited preclusion of RAIT, potential need for completion thyroidectomy, frequent inability to avoid chronic thyroid hormone replacement, and limitations of supportive evidence as arguments against widely applying lobectomy. Significant divergence involved ATA 2015's guidance regarding RAIT. European panelists favored wider use of post-operative RAIT than does ATA 2015. Rationales included the modality's association with favorable patient outcomes and generally limited toxicity, and lack of high-quality evidence supporting withholding RAIT. Additionally, European panelists favored recombinant human thyrotropin in more settings than does ATA 2015, citing avoidance of hypothyroid morbidity and quality-of-life impairment, without apparent sacrifice in oncologic outcomes. Based on clinicial evidence plus theoretical advantages, European experts advocated dosimetric versus fixed-activity RAIT approaches for advanced DTC. European panelists noted that the ATA 2015 risk stratification system requires information sometimes unavailable in everyday practice. ATA 2015 recommendations regarding radioiodine-refractory DTC should consider potential palliative benefits of RAIT in patients who also have radioiodine-susceptible lesions. CONCLUSIONS: European panelists suggested modifications to approximately one-third of ATA 2015 recommendations. Varying European and ATA 2015 perspectives can stimulate analysis and discussion of literature and performance of primary research to resolve discrepant recommendations and potentially improve patient outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND Oxidative stress and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) have been reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of anakinra, which is an IL-1beta receptor antagonist, on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, through biochemical, gene expression and histopathological analyses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was designed with 4 groups. For 1 week, the control group (C) and the cisplatin (Cis) group received distilled water, while the cisplatin + anakinra 50 (Cis + ANA50) group and the cisplatin + anakinra 100 (Cis + ANA100) group were intraperitoneally administered 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of anakinra, respectively. The Cis, Cis + ANA50 and Cis + ANA100 groups were intraperitoneally injected with a 2.5 mg/kg dose of cisplatin for 7 days. After sacrifice, the kidney tissue of each rat was extracted for the assessment of the malondialdehyde (MDA) and total glutathione (tGSH) levels, and for gene expression analyses of IL-1beta. The kidney tissues were histopathologically evaluated. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The administration of cisplatin (the Cis group) yielded a higher level of MDA (4.75 +/-0.25 nmol/mL; p < 0.001) and lower levels of tGSH (1.80 +/-0.35 mg/L; p < 0.001) compared to other groups. Cisplatin also increased IL-1beta gene expression (6.33 +/-0.27 gene expression levels; p < 0.001) compared to other groups. The impact of anakinra on the MDA and tGSH levels, and on IL-1beta gene expression induced by cisplatin was observed as a reversal of these findings (p < 0.05). Anakinra better prevented an increase of the levels of MDA and IL-1beta at a dose of 100 mg/kg compared to a 50 mg/kg dose. CONCLUSIONS: Anakinra prevents oxidative kidney damage induced by cisplatin, in a dose-dependent manner. This result suggests that anakinra may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-induced kidney damage.

AB  - Progranulin (PGRN) is predominantly expressed by microglia in the brain, and genetic and experimental evidence suggests a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We asked whether PGRN expression is changed in a disease severity-specific manner in AD We measured PGRN in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in two of the best-characterized AD patient cohorts, namely the Dominant Inherited Alzheimer's Disease Network (DIAN) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In carriers of AD causing dominant mutations, cross-sectionally assessed CSF PGRN increased over the course of the disease and significantly differed from non-carriers 10 years before the expected symptom onset. In late-onset AD, higher CSF PGRN was associated with more advanced disease stages and cognitive impairment. Higher CSF PGRN was associated with higher CSF soluble TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) only when there was underlying pathology, but not in controls. In conclusion, we demonstrate that, although CSF PGRN is not a diagnostic biomarker for AD, it may together with sTREM2 reflect microglial activation during the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND The conventional radiologic features that differentiate benign from malignant bone lesions were originally described using radiography (x-ray [XR]). When evaluating sectional imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), one may apply these principles to identify malignant bone lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of these radiographic features for detecting malignity when applied to CT and MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by our institutional ethical board. Thirty-nine patients with histopathologic proof of a high-grade bone malignancy and preoperative imaging data obtained with a minimum of two different modalities were included in the study. Four radiologists reviewed the images and scored the lesions for distinctness of margins, presence and type of periosteal reaction, matrix mineralization, and presence of soft tissue mass. The average score for each modality was then tested for accuracy with regard to the histopathology. RESULTS: When lesion margins were considered, XR was the best modality to detect a high-grade malignancy. MRI, especially postcontrast T1-weighted sequence, was the least helpful in this regard. There was no significant difference between CT and XR and between CT and MRI. When the periosteal reaction was considered, XR was the best modality to detect the malignant type of periosteal reaction. In this regard, MRI and CT were misleading; either by not detecting or undergrading periosteal reaction. MRI was the best modality to detect soft tissue mass. CONCLUSION: Conventional imaging criteria for bone malignancy can be misleading when applied to MRI or CT. When cross-sectional imaging features contradict those from XR, the latter should be the guide for clinical management.

AB  - Introduction Granulomatous lung disease (GLD) is caused by a wide range of conditions and it is challenge for pulmonologist. A detailed history of exposures is fundamental in GDL and has been found pivotal to reach a precise diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Between September 2014 and December 2016, the distribution of patients diagnosed with granulomatous lymphadenitis in the mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or mediastinoscopy was analyzed. To be listed as 'confident', a diagnosis of sarcoidosis required compatible histological, radiological and clinical findings in conjunction with negative cultures. Infectious entities listed as 'confident' had either microorganisms in tissue section, positive culture, positive serology or positive antigen detection in a consistent clinical pathological setting. Result: Granulomatous lymphadenitis was detected in 110 patients. The included 110 cases consisted of 70.9% women and median age of 53 (range 44-61) years. The final diagnosis of the patients was accepted to be sarcoidosis in 79 (71.8%), sarcoid like granulomas in 7 (6.4%), tuberculosis in 4 (3.6%), silicosis in 4 (3.6%), drug-associated granuloma in 2 (1.8%), hypersensitivity pneumonitis in 1 (0.9%), Chron disease in 1 (0.9%), unspecified in 12 (10.9%). Three patients were classified as tuberculosis based on culture. Conclusions: In this study, we found that the most common cause of granulomatous lymphadenitis was sarcoidosis. Contrary to expectations, the number of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis was very low.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES Testicular ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury develops after torsion and following detorsion of the testis. Reactive oxygen species were produced and oxidative damage begins to occur due to I/R process. Nimesulide, which is a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor drug, have antioxidant, antiinflammatory, analgesics and antipyretic effects. We aimed to investigate biochemically and histopathologically effect of nimesulide on testis I/R injury in rats induced by the testicular torsion-detorsion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, 24 albino Wistar male rats were divided into four groups (6 rats in each group): ischemia/reperfusion applied+50mg/kg nimesulide administrated (NIM-50), ischemia/reperfusion applied+100mg/kg nimesulide administrated (NIM-100), ischemia/reperfusion applied (IR) and Sham surgery (SS) groups. Nimesulide was administered to NIM-50 and NIM-100 groups at the 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg doses before 2h applied I/R procedures. The IR group were applied only I/R procedures, no drug treatment was applied. Animals were sacrificed under high dose anesthesia and left testes were extracted. Testes were examined biochemically and histopathologically. RESULTS: Total glutathione (tGSH) and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) levels were increased in the NIM-50 and NIM-100 groups compared to IR group. The levels of COX-2, malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were lower in the NIM-50 and NIM-100 groups than in the IR group. Some histopathological changes seen in IR group. This findings were decreased in NIM-50 group and prevented in NIM-100 group. CONCLUSION: Nimesulide prevented inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results suggest that nimesulide may be have a protective effect on testicular I/R injury.

AB  - Objective Uterine sarcomas are very rare malignancies, and when a hysterectomy is performed for benign causes, a risk of about 1/500 is mentioned for possible uterine sarcomas. Endometrial stromal neoplasms are a rare subgroup of uterine sarcomas that account for less than 10% of all uterine sarcomas. Mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle tumors, also known as stromomyomas, are defined as having at least 30% each of endometrial stromal and smooth muscle components. As a result, stromomyoma is an extremely rare malignant mixed mesenchymal tumor of the uterus. Both clinically and histologically, the differential diagnosis is challenging. Stromomyoma should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of large uterine masses, even if these masses are seen in an asymptomatic woman of reproductive age. In this study, we aimed to present this bizarre tumor of the uterus detected in a premenopausal woman.

AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway plays crucial roles during the carcinogenesis and metastasis. Transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2) is a key molecule for the regulation of TGF-beta pathway and frequently downregulated or lost in several cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and TGF-beta pathway is often regulated by negative feedback mechanisms but little is known about the mechanism of TGFBR2 downregulation in NSCLC. Here, we found that the expression of miR-520e is upregulated in metastatic tumor tissues compared to non-metastatic ones and its expression is inversely correlated with that of TGFBR2 in clinical samples. We also discovered that TGF-beta dramatically increased the expression of miR-520e, which targeted and downregulated TGFBR2, and the suppression of miR-520e significantly impaired TGF-beta-induced TGFBR2 downregulation. ChIP-PCR experiments further showed that miR-520e is transcriptionally induced by SMAD2/3 in response to TGF-beta. Our findings reveal a novel negative feedback mechanism in TGF-beta signaling and the expression level of miR-520e could be a predictive biomarker for NSCLC metastasis.

AB  - Aim of the study was to examine the effect of deslorelin on uterine tissues of eleven pre-pubertal bitches aged 4.2 +/- 0.6 m. Implants containing placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%; n = 4, G I), 4.7 mg (n = 3, GII) or 9.4 mg (n = 4, GIII) deslorelin acetate (Suprelorin((R)) ; Virbac, France), were administered subcutaneously. Signs of oestrus, vaginal cytology, serum progesterone (P4) and estradiol-17beta (E2) concentrations were monitored until the occurrence of oestrus. Bitches were ovariohysterectomized and sections from the uterine tissue were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detection of GnRH receptor (R), Kisspeptin (KP)10, Kisspeptin receptor (GPR54), androgen receptor (AR), oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha,beta, and progesterone receptor (PR). Tissue sections were scored semi-quantitatively using an immunoreactivity score (IRS) ranging from 0 to 300 (3). Since some animals were ovariohysterectomized before puberty (n = 1 from GII and n = 2 from GIII), and some in metestrus (all controls and 2 from GII and GIII each), results from these animals were separately evaluated and compared to the controls. Results: No abnormalities were seen in uterine tissues. Kisspeptin 10 expression was low in all cell types, highest IRS were seen in the vascular endothelial cells. The GPR54 was mainly detected in the luminal epithelial cells, superficial and deep uterine glands. The expression of GPR54 and ERalpha,beta was especially high in bitches operated prepubertally. No difference was observed between the controls and experimental bitches operated in their first metestrus. The PR and ERalpha,beta were exclusively expressed in superficial and deep uterine glands and luminal surface epithelial cells. The AR and GnRH-R expression was negative in all cells of all groups. We conclude that application of 4.7 or 9.4 mg deslorelin at the age of 4 months did not cause uterine disturbances. GPR54 expression might be influenced by pre-pubertal deslorelin treatment or the changings related to approaching puberty; the latter is supposed in case of ERalpha,beta.

AB  - INTRODUCTION The usefulness of sericin as pleurodesis agent has previously been described. Present study aims to compare sericin pleurodesis regarding success, effectiveness, tolerability, and side-effects. METHODS: Adult, 12-week-old Wistar-albino rats (n=60), divided to five groups as sericin, talcum-powder, doxycycline, silver-nitrate and control. Agents were administrated through left thoracotomy, rats sacrificed twelve-days after. RESULTS: Highest ratio of collagen fibers was observed in sericin group, and the intensity was higher than talcum-powder group (p<0.05). Compared to silver nitrate, sericin group displayed better mesothelial reaction, and multi-layer mesothelium was also better (p<0.05). Foreign body reaction and emphysema were less frequent in sericin group (p<0.05). The presence of biological tissue in parenchyma was less prominent in sericin group (p<0.05). Foreign body reaction on thoracic wall was less common in sericin group (p<0.05). Presence of biological tissue glue in thoracic wall was less prominent in sericin group (p<0.05). Glomerular degeneration was lower in sericin group compared to the silver nitrate group (p<0.05), and tubular degeneration was less common in sericin group than talcum group (p<0.05). Pericarditis was less common in sericin group compared to the other groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: As an intrinsic, natural glue protein, sericin protects the lung parenchyma and tissues, and its glue-like characteristics enable pleurodesis. The success of sericin in pleurodesis was demonstrated in the present study based on investigations of the pleurae. Being cost-effective and better tolerated agent associated with a low potential of side effects, sericin is more effective, less expensive and provides more lung parenchyma protection.

AB  - The SPECC1L protein plays a role in adherens junctions involved in cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton organization, microtubule stabilization, spindle organization and cytokinesis. It modulates PI3K-AKT signaling and controls cranial neural crest cell delamination during facial morphogenesis. SPECC1L causative variants were first identified in individuals with oblique facial clefts. Recently, causative variants in SPECC1L were reported in a pedigree reported in 1988 as atypical Opitz GBBB syndrome. Six families with SPECC1L variants have been reported thus far. We report here eight further pedigrees with SPECC1L variants, including a three-generation family, and a further individual of a previously published family. We discuss the nosology of Teebi and GBBB, and the syndromes related to SPECC1L variants. Although the phenotype of individuals with SPECC1L mutations shows overlap with Opitz syndrome in its craniofacial anomalies, the canonical laryngeal malformations and male genital anomalies are not observed. Instead, individuals with SPECCL1 variants have branchial fistulae, omphalocele, diaphragmatic hernias, and uterus didelphis. We also point to the clinical overlap of SPECC1L syndrome with mild Baraitser-Winter craniofrontofacial syndrome: they share similar dysmorphic features (wide, short nose with a large tip, cleft lip and palate, blepharoptosis, retrognathia, and craniosynostosis), although intellectual disability, neuronal migration defect, and muscular problems remain largely specific to Baraitser-Winter syndrome. In conclusion, we suggest that patients with pathogenic variants in SPECC1L should not be described as "dominant (or type 2) Opitz GBBB syndrome", and instead should be referred to as "SPECC1L syndrome" as both disorders show distinctive, non overlapping developmental anomalies beyond facial communalities.

AB  - Dysfunction of motile monocilia, altering the leftward flow at the embryonic node essential for determination of left-right body asymmetry, is a major cause of laterality defects. Laterality defects are also often associated with reduced mucociliary clearance caused by defective multiple motile cilia of the airway and are responsible for destructive airway disease. Outer dynein arms (ODAs) are essential for ciliary beat generation, and human respiratory cilia contain different ODA heavy chains (HCs): the panaxonemally distributed gamma-HC DNAH5, proximally located beta-HC DNAH11 (defining ODA type 1), and the distally localized beta-HC DNAH9 (defining ODA type 2). Here we report loss-of-function mutations in DNAH9 in five independent families causing situs abnormalities associated with subtle respiratory ciliary dysfunction. Consistent with the observed subtle respiratory phenotype, high-speed video microscopy demonstrates distally impaired ciliary bending in DNAH9 mutant respiratory cilia. DNAH9-deficient cilia also lack other ODA components such as DNAH5, DNAI1, and DNAI2 from the distal axonemal compartment, demonstrating an essential role of DNAH9 for distal axonemal assembly of ODAs type 2. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicate interaction of DNAH9 with the ODA components DNAH5 and DNAI2 as well as the ODA-docking complex component CCDC114. We further show that during ciliogenesis of respiratory cilia, first proximally located DNAH11 and then distally located DNAH9 is assembled in the axoneme. We propose that the beta-HC paralogs DNAH9 and DNAH11 achieved specific functional roles for the distinct axonemal compartments during evolution with human DNAH9 function matching that of ancient beta-HCs such as that of the unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

AB  - Current study was designed to investigate the protective effects of royal jelly on Flunixin me- glumine (FM)-induced spermiotoxicity related to sperm concentration, abnormal spermatozoa count and histopathological changes in mice testis. The subjects were divided into five groups according to FM and/or royal jelly intake: Control group; group 1, FM alone (25 mg/kg, im); group 2, combination of FM (25 mg/kg, im) and royal jelly (200 mg/kg, oral); group 3, FM alone (50 mg/kg, im); and group 4, combination of FM (50 mg/kg, im) and royal jelly (200 mg/kg, oral). The animals were fed once daily for 15 days and they were sacrificed last day. Epididymal sperm concentration and abnormal spermatozoa count were noted. Testicular histological findings were evaluated. On purpose, organization of each animal was graded according to Johnsen's scoring to assess the spermatogenesis relying on seminiferous tubule cross-section scores. Comparing to controls, FM administration caused a decrease in sperm concentration (p0.05), an increase in total abnormal spermatozoa rates (p0.05) and more degenerative changes in testes in mice. Royal jelly supplementation ameliorated both sperm concentration and abnormal spermato- zoa (p0.05) comparing to the control group. In conclusion, we suggested that royal jelly might have protective effects in the FM-induced reductions in epididymal sperm concentration and in- crease in abnormal spermatozoa rate.

AB  - BACKGROUND In the treatment of irreparable rotary cuff (RC) tears, the superior capsule of the shoulder is reconstructed using tensor fascia lata (TFL) or several allografts to prevent progressive joint degeneration. This study compared the healing qualities of acellular human dermal graft (HDG) and the TFL autograft in superior capsule reconstruction (SCR) from biomechanical and histologic perspectives. METHODS: Chronic retracted RC tear models were created bilaterally in 9 rabbits, and 7 rabbits with intact RC were used as a control group. SCR was performed 8 weeks after the tear using HDG in right shoulders and TFL in left shoulders. At 12 weeks after SCR, 2 shoulders from each experimental group were investigated for histologic healing, and 7 samples from the experimental and control groups were biomechanically tested. RESULTS: Complete healing was observed macroscopically in the glenoid and humeral sides of both groups. No difference was observed in the enthesis maturation scores between the experimental groups. Collagen fiber density was higher and the orientation was better in TFL group. Inflammatory cell infiltration was not seen in the TFL group, but inflammatory cell infiltration was pronounced in the HDG group. The mean pullout strengths of the TFL group, HDG group, and intact RC group were 139.7 +/- 40.5 N, 123.9 +/- 47.9 N, and 105.1 +/- 11.8 N (P = .187), respectively. The mean stiffness values (P = .711), yield forces (P = .404), and displacements (P = .135) were also statistically not different between the groups. CONCLUSION: In SCR, the healing qualities of HDG and TFL were similar in rabbit models.

AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major neonatal health problem that especially affects preterm infants and causes severe morbidity and mortality. Although its pathogenesis is not fully understood, important risk factors include prematurity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Ankaferd Blood Stopper(R) (ABS) has antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, antiapoptotic, and wound healing accelerant properties. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether treatment with ABS reduced the severity of NEC in rat pups in an experimental NEC model. Thirty-six newborn Wistar albino rat pups were randomly assigned to the control, NEC + saline, or NEC + ABS groups. NEC was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide, feeding with hyperosmolar enteral formula, and exposure to hypoxia/hyperoxia and cold stress. ABS was administered intraperitoneally to the pups in the NEC + ABS group daily starting on day 1 of the study at a dose of 2 ml/kg by diluting 2 ml with saline at a ratio of 1:3. All pups were sacrificed on day 4. The terminal ileum including the proximal colon was removed for histopathological and immunohistochemical examination and biochemical analysis. Macroscopic assessment and intestinal injury scores were lower in NEC + ABS group compared to the NEC + saline group (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical evaluations of caspase-3, -8, and -9 revealed significantly reduced apoptosis in the NEC + ABS group compared to the NEC + saline group (p = 0.001). Total oxidant status, oxidative stress index, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta levels, and lipid, protein, and deoxyribonucleic acid oxidation products were significantly lower in the NEC + ABS group compared to NEC + saline group (p < 0.001 for all), while total antioxidant status, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase levels were higher in the NEC + ABS group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.01, respectively). ABS treatment has the potential to effectively reduce the severity of intestinal damage in NEC due to its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. Therefore, NEC may be an alternative option for treatment.

AB  - An 81-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus presented with signs of orbital cellulitis and a gangrenous ulcer on the right palate. Biopsy analysis confirmed a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. Surgical debridement of necrotic tissues and enucleation of the right eye were performed. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was isolated from the specimens. The patient remained stable under antibiotic therapy and underwent reconstructive surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a rare case of orbital necrotizing fasciitis developing secondary to S. maltophilia infection. Orbital necrotizing fasciitis is rare; the early clinical features may be similar to those of cellulitis. To prevent devastating complications, the former condition must be kept in mind, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE In this study, we aimed to investigate the antioxidant effects of selenium and coenzyme Q on renal damage in a partial unilateral ureteral obstruction (PUUO) in a rat model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 24 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups as Group 1 Control Group, Group 2, PUUO Group, Group 3 PUUO + coenzyme Q group, Group 4 PUUO + selenium group. Paraoxonase (PON), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant levels (TOS) were analyzed biochemically from tissue and blood samples. Tissue samples were examined histopathologically. RESULTS: The TAC in the tissues was found to be statistically significantly increased in Groups 3 and 4, compared to Group 2. Tissue TOS was found to be significantly reduced in Groups 3 and 4, compared to Group 2. Serum PON levels were significantly increased in Group 3 and 4, compared to Group 1 and 2. Histopathological examination showed that interstitial inflammation and congestion were lesser in the coenzyme Q and selenium groups than in the PUUO group. A more significant decrease was found in the selenium group than in the coenzyme Q group. CONCLUSION: Our study results showed that coenzyme Q and selenium reduced the oxidation and the damage in tissue in PUUO in rats.

AB  - AIMS Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene mutations have long been associated with apparently sporadic pituitary adenomas (PAs) with a prevalence range of 0-12%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of germline AIP variations in a large cohort of apparently sporadic PAs diagnosed before the age of 40 years, who did not exhibit hypercalcemia and/or MEN1 syndrome components during long-term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 97 patients, diagnosed with functional PAs </=40 years old, composed of somatotropinoma (n = 55), prolactinoma (n = 25), and corticotrophinoma (n = 17), were recruited for this study. Fifty-one of these patients [somatotropinoma (n = 30), prolactinoma (n = 15), and corticotrophinoma (n = 11)] were previously reported as AIP mutation-negative by Sanger sequencing. The entire coding sequence of the AIP gene, along with exon/intron boundaries and the untranslated regions of 41 newly recruited patients, were sequenced for germline variations. In addition, all patients were subjected to multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to detect copy number variations in the AIP gene. RESULTS: The AIP c.911G>A: p.Arg304Gln (rs104894190) variant was detected in only two patients with functional PA: one with somatotropinoma [in 1/55 (1.8%)] and one with prolactinoma [in 1/25 (4%)]. None of the corticotrophinomas revealed AIP gene alterations. Thus, the overall prevalence of AIP variation was 2.1% in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Germline AIP gene variations among Turkish patients with apparently sporadic PAs are relatively rare among patients </=40 years old. None of the patients in our cohort revealed any obviously pathogenic AIP variants.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The accurate identification of hyper functioning parathyroid gland is needed for definitive surgical treatment in primary hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasonography and 99mTechnetium sestamibi scintigraphy are the two most used methods with varying sensitivities. This study aimed to assess the value of parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay in preoperative ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (FNA)-PTH washout fluid to verify the correct localisation of lesions with negative or inconclusive scintigraphy results. METHODS: We evaluated data of 28 lesions in 21 patients who underwent US-guided parathyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with PTH washout, retrospectively. The PTH washout results and the reports of parathyroid surgery and imaging studies were reviewed. RESULTS: Of operated 28 lesions 23 had positive and 5 had negative washout results. The median FNA-PTH washout was 2315.5 pg/ ml (min-max: 12.3-6978 pg/ ml). The calculated sensitivity of FNA-PTH washout was 85.7% and the specifity was 28.6%. The positive and negative predictive values were 78.3% and 40.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: FNA-PTH can be used to establish the nature of the lesion, discriminate parathyroid gland from thyroid lesions or cervical lymph nodes, improving the surgical outcomes. It can be used to localise parathyroid lesions preoperatively when negative or discordant ultrasound and scintigraphy findings are obtained.

AB  - Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the uterine cervix is a rare aggressive tumor. The examination of a cervicovaginal smear from a 31-year-old patient diagnosed with LCNEC after a cervical polypectomy during the 32nd week of pregnancy was carried out. The observed atypical cells had large cytoplasm, increased nucleus: cytoplasm ratio with the nucleus containing coarse, dispersed chromatin, and were arranged in a pseudorosette formation, which all confirmed the diagnosis. In addition, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) was determined in the histopathological examination of the subsequent hysterectomy material. Given the rarity of this condition, we present and discuss the case herein.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS Today, invasive diagnostic tests are necessary for definite diagnosis of adult celiac disease (CD). However, in selected children patients, the need for invasive tests is ceased. In this study, we evaluated adult patients according to the ESPGHAN (European Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition Society) criteria. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (aged 17-66) with symptoms of CD were included. Serum samples were tested for total IgA, tTG-IgA (antitissue transglutaminase), tTG-IgG, DGP-IgA (antideamidated gliadin peptide), DGP-IgG, and EMA (endomysial antibodies). HLA-DQ typing was studied with PCR-SSP (sequence-specific primers) method. Biopsy samples were evaluated according to Marsh scoring. RESULTS: In CD patients, 71.4% (15/21) of the patients were diagnosed without biopsy according to the EPSGHAN criteria but when ESPGHAN's IgA tTG threshold value for children was taken into consideration (>200 IU/mL), the sensitivity decreased to 81%. Celiac disease diagnosed and control groups were compared in terms of HLA tissue types. DQ2.5 homozygous or DQ2.5/DQ2.2 was significantly higher in CD group, and DQ2- or DQ8-negative HLA tissue type was significantly higher in control group. CONCLUSION: When serological tests, HLA typing, and clinical symptoms are all in favor of CD, biopsy may not be performed in selected adult CD patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Atrophic rhinitis (AR) is a disease characterized by atrophy of the mucosa, submucosa, bone tissue due to an unknown cause and excessive nasal cavity enlargement. The disease still has no complete treatment, and the treatment of the functional loss of atrophic cells in AR is still a matter to be investigated. Ozone (O3) therapy has been shown to enhance cell metabolism, angiogenesis, fibroblast activity, and collagen synthesis. AIM: To determine whether ozone treatment affects the disease histopathologically, in experimentally created AR. Material - Method: Twelve Wistar Hanover strain albino male rats were included in the study. Atrophic rhinitis was induced in animals by administering Pasteurella multocida toxin diluted with saline for 21 days to both nasal cavities. A total of 12 animals included in the study were divided into 2 groups as control and study. Ozone gas (60 mug/mL) was administered rectally to the study group for 21 days. After 2 weeks, the rats were decapitated, the nasal cavities were removed as a block, and atrophic rhinitis parameters (epithelial hyperplasia, goblet cell loss, cilia loss, inflammatory infiltration, and vascular ectasia) were evaluated under light microscopy by histopathological examination and statistically interpreted. RESULT: The incidence of vascular ectasia was significantly lower in the ozone group compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding other histopathologic findings. CONCLUSION: Ozone treatment was moderate at the histopathological level. We concluded that ozone therapy has no or very limited effect on atrophic rhinitis.

AB  - Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is a type of drug reaction characterized by localized erythema, hyperpigmentation, and bullous at the same site(s), generally observed following every intake of a causative drug. Delayed-type cellular hypersensitivity (Type IVC) is considered to play a role in FDE etiology. Several antibiotics, barbiturates, oral contraceptives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, laxative-containing phenolphthalein, metronidazole, and quinine are known to be the primary drugs responsible for FDE. Bullous FDE, on the other hand, is a relatively rare form of FDE. Hepatitis B is a significant worldwide health problem, and entecavir is a common nucleoside (deoxyguanosine) analog used for treating hepatitis B; however, it has various side effects, such as lactic acidosis, myalgia, azotemia, hypophosphatemia, headache, diarrhea, pancreatitis, and neuropathy, and, in rare cases, cutaneous drug eruption. Our aim is to present a case of entecavir-associated bullous drug reaction, which has not been reported in the literature. Furthermore, we performed a review of literature to compile previously reported entecavir-associated drug reactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS This study aimed to determine a predictive bioindicator that would detect the treatment response of patients diagnosed with rectal cancer and treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data collected from 37 patients receiving nCRT were retrospectively evaluated. The p53 score and gene instability in MLH1 and MSH2, which are among the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, were evaluated using immunohistochemical methods. The neutrophils-leukocytes ratio (NLR), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 values were obtained as hematological parameters from computer records. The pathologic analysis of the therapy response after nCRT was classified according to the modified grading system by Ryan et al. Results: The changes in the NLR, CEA, and CA19-9 values before and after treatment were statistically significant (p</=0.001 and p=0.005). A near significant effect of the decrease of the CEA value in the 5th week after treatment was detected on the pathological response score (p=0.075). The p53 mutation score in those patients with any residue was higher than the total response. Overall, 89.2% of the patients exhibited MMR positivity (stability), and 10.8% of the cases with MRM negativity (instability) had a macroscopic residue. Cases with pathological total response were MRM positive. CONCLUSION: Consequently, in most of the patients treated with nCRT, the treatment caused tumor and nodal remission. In the prediction of this therapy response, hematological and genetic parameters, such as NLR, P53, MLH1, and MSH2, play a predictive role.

AB  - BACKGROUND Massive localized lymphedema (MLL) is a non-neoplastic benign soft tissue lesion that may be confused with sarcomas or other neoplastic proliferations both clinically and morphologically. Most occur in morbidly obese adults on the lower extremities. The objective of this article is to document a case of MLL in the retroperitoneal cavity which is a previously unreported site for this lesion, and to highlight its unusual clinical features. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a non-obese male who had undergone major abdominal surgery due to bladder extrophy 17 years ago. Abdominal ultrasonography detected a large incidental mass in the right renal sinus during his investigation for nephrolithiasis. The lesion extending from renal pelvis down to pelvis was resected and its histopathological findings were compatible with massive localized lymphedema. CONCLUSIONS: Retroperitoneum has to be added to the list of locations that MLL can be found. Liposarcoma will be a challenging differential diagnosis when the lesion is encountered in an unusual site.

AB  - Multilocus sequence analysis of Xanthomonas species revealed a very close relationship between Xanthomonas cynarae, an artichoke pathogen and Xanthomonas gardneri, a tomato and pepper pathogen. Results of whole genome sequence comparisons using average nucleotide identity between representative strains of X. gardneri and X. cynarae were well above the threshold of 95-96 %. Inoculations of X. gardneri strains in artichoke leaves caused mild disease symptoms, but only weak symptoms were observed in the bracts. Both X. cynarae and X. gardneri grew equally and caused typical bacterial spot symptoms in pepper after artificial inoculation. However, X. cynarae induced a hypersensitive reaction in tomato, while X. gardneri strains were virulent. Pathogenicity-associated gene clusters, including the protein secretion systems, type III effector profiles, and lipopolysaccharide cluster were nearly identical between the two species. Based on our results from whole genome sequence comparison, X. gardneri and X. cynarae belong to the same species. The name X. cynarae has priority and X. gardneri should be considered as a later heterotypic synonym. An emended description of X. cynarae (type strain=CFBP 4188(T), =DSM 16794(T)) is given. However, due to the host specificity in artichoke and tomato, two pathovars, X. cynarae pv. cynarae and X. cynarae pv. gardneri, are proposed.

AB  - AIM Complication rates are low and endobronchial ultrasound guided needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is generally regarded as a safe procedure, but there is a very limited number of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of the procedure in advanced ages. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and performance outcomes of EBUS-TBNA in elderly. METHODS: It was a retrospective observational study; patients who received EBUS-TBNA between September 2016 and January 2018 were evaluated. We analyzed patient's characteristics, doses of midazolam, and lidocaine used, regions of lymph node biopsies, and complications. Also, functionality and general physical status of patients over 65 years of age were evaluated. RESULTS: During study period 132 cases of EBUS-TBNA were evaluated. 39 (29.5%) cases were aged 70 years, and over. There were more comorbidities in older group. Performance status of older group was worse. Furthermore, when evaluated according to American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), the older group was found to be composed of the riskier patients. When patients aged between 65 and 69, and over 70 compared, older patient's Barthel, EQ 5-D, SGA, and G8 scores were found to be worse. Despite that, there was no difference in the frequency, and types of complications between both groups. Diagnostic performance was not different between age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Independent from comorbidities, general health status, and functionality EBUS-TBNA procedure in 70-year-old and over patients is a safe minimally invasive procedure.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Perivascular epithelioid celltumor (PEComa) is a rare mesenchymal neoplasia and can be found in various body sites. On the other hand, hepatic PEComa is very rare, with only a few studies having reported hepatic malignant PEComa. There is no gold standard regarding the use of diagnostic imaging studies. The diagnosis of hepatic PEComa is made by a positive immunohistochemical staining for HMB45 and Melan A. Herein, we discussed the therapeutic and follow-up process of a symptomatic hepatic PEComa case. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 22-year-old woman presented with a palpable mass in abdomen. A computerized tomographic examination showed a giant hepatic mass of left lobe origin, which was excised surgically. The pathology result was reported as a PEComa. DISCUSSION: The diagnostic approach, treatment modalities, and follow-up procedures are not standard. The main treatment modality for PEComa is surgical excision with adequate surgical margin. CONCLUSION: A longer follow-up is required for patients with hepatic PEComa because the nature of the disease is not entirely clear.

AB  - There are a number of studies investigating anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin in patients with sepsis and animal models. There are a few studies which investigated effect of simvastatin on elements in sepsis. In the present study, the impact of pretreatment with simvastatin on element levels was evaluated in liver during endotoxemia. Rats were divided into control, LPS, simvastatin, and simvastatin + LPS. The histopathologic examination of the liver was performed using hematoxylin and eosin. Selenium, zinc, iron, manganese, magnesium, and copper were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy. In the LPS, the hepatocyte cell structure was damaged. In the simvastatin + LPS, hepatocyte, and sinusoidal cord damage were partially smaller than LPS. Levels of selenium, and copper significantly decreased in both of LPS and simvastatin + LPS. In the LPS group, iron was found to increase. In the simvastatin + LPS, zinc was increased. Simvastatin partially smaller liver damage by increasing zinc levels during endotoxemia.

AB  - We examined the protective effects of hesperidin on cerebral vasospasm by establishing an experimental rat model of subarachnoid haemorrhage and performing biochemical, pathological and histomorphometric analysis on these data. Forty albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups of n = 8 in each: Group (G)1, no experimental interventions; G2, subjected to subarachnoid haemorrhage; G3, subjected to subarachnoid haemorrhage and administered saline (100 mg/kg); G4, subjected to subarachnoid haemorrhage and treated with low dose hesperidin (50 mg/kg); G5, subjected to subarachnoid haemorrhage and treated with high dose hesperidin (100 mg/kg). Subarachnoid haemorrhage was created by injecting 0.15 cc of autologous blood taken from the rat-tail artery and injected into the cisterna magna from the craniocervical junction. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally as twice daily doses for 48 h. Rats were sacrificed at the end of this period. No statistically significant decrease was observed in malondialdehyde levels, which is the end-product of lipid peroxidation, among the drug groups (G4 and G5). Thin sections prepared from the basilar artery were examined morphologically. Severe luminal narrowing and vessel-wall thickening were observed in the subarachnoid-haemorrhage groups (G2, G3). In the hesperidin-administered groups (G4, G5), it was determined that vessel-wall-thickness measurements revealed thinner walls than in the subarachnoid-haemorrhage groups (G2, G3) and the luminal diameters were significantly larger than in the subarachnoid-haemorrhage groups (G2, G3). These findings suggest that hesperidin has no effect on malondialdehyde-associated lipid-peroxidation activity; however, it might be useful in subarachnoid-haemorrhage therapy because of its beneficial effects on vessel-wall thickness and luminal diameters.

AB  - Activating mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene are the most common genetic alterations in urothelial carcinoma (UC) of the bladder and upper urinary tract. While the cadherin 1 (CDH1) gene is commonly mutated in the clinically aggressive plasmacytoid variant of urothelial carcinoma (PUC), little is known about their TERT promoter mutation status. A retrospective search of our archives for PUC and UC with plasmacytoid and/or signet ring cell features (2007-2014) was performed. Ten specimens from 10 patients had archived material available for DNA analysis and were included in the study. Intratumoral areas of non-plasmacytoid histology were also evaluated when present. Samples were analyzed for TERT promoter mutations with Safe-SeqS, a sequencing error-reduction technology, and sequenced using a targeted panel of the 10 most commonly mutated genes in bladder cancer on the Illumina MiSeq platform. TERT promoter mutations were detected in specimens with pure and focal plasmacytoid features (6 of 10). Similar to conventional UC, the predominant mutation identified was g.1295228C>T. In heterogeneous tumors with focal variant histology, concordant mutations were found in plasmacytoid and corresponding conventional, glandular, or sarcomatoid areas. Co-occurring mutations in tumor protein p53 (TP53, 2 cases) and kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) viral proto-oncogene (1 case) were also detected. TERT promoter mutations are frequently present in PUC, which provides further evidence that TERT promoter mutations are common events in bladder cancer, regardless of histologic subtype, and supports their inclusion in any liquid biopsy assay for bladder cancer.

AB  - Serous effusion fluid is one of the most commonly encountered specimens in routine cytopathology practice. It provides invaluable information about the patient and the clinical status; but to get the most of it, specimen handling and processing must be carried out properly. Cytomorphology is the basis of a successful analysis which should complemented by ancillary tests when needed. A wide spectrum of ancillary techniques - ranging from immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry to different assays of molecular pathology - can be applied to serous effusions. This article describes the acquisition and management of serous effusion fluids, methods for preservation and transportation, different techniques of cytopreparation, application of immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), as well as DNA extraction for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next generation sequencing (NGS). Principles of bio-banking of effusion samples are also discussed which is getting more important in correlation with the developments in personalized medicine. This article is protected by copyright.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological studies demonstrated that thymol (Thym) and oleuropein (Ole) have therapeutic potential for gastric ulcers. The molecular mechanism underlying the gastroprotective effects of these compounds have not been elucidated yet especially for their individual and combination use at high dose. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore their gastroprotective mechanisms on indomethacin (Indo)-induced gastric ulcer model. Ole (50,100, 250, and 500 mg/kg) and Thym (50,100, 200, and 500 mg/kg) were orally administered to the rats 10 min before the induction of ulcer with Indo. The combination of 500 mg/kg doses of Ole and Thym were applied. The gastric mucosa was evaluated histopathologically. Moreover, TAC/TOS, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and caspase-3 levels were assessed by ELISA and the caspase-3 and TNF-alpha expressions were quantified by qRT-PCR. Indo-induced histopathological changes while Ole and Thym pretreatment prevented these effects. Unlike the 500 mg/kg dose of Ole treatment, the 500 mg/kg dose of Thym administration enhanced these damages. The decreased TAC, PGE2 levels and increased TOS, eNOS, TNF-alpha, caspase-3 levels were obtained in Indo group. However, these changes were reversed by Ole and Thym groups except the 500 mg/kg dose of Thym and the combination treatment groups. Similar trends were observed in the caspase-3 and TNF-alpha expression levels. These results demonstrated that enhanced inflammation, oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, and apoptotic activities were occurred in Indo, 500 mg/kg dose of Thym and the combination treatment groups while not in the other groups. The findings demonstrated the gastroprotective ability of Ole and low doses of Thym in gastric ulcer models.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors of recurrence in uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex-cord tumors (UTROSCT) and to determine clinical-pathological characteristics, treatment options and outcome. MATERIAL AND METHOD: An electronic literature search was conducted from 1976 to 2018. After the comprehensive evaluation and conjunction with our case, the study included 79 cases. RESULTS: The median age at initial diagnosis was 49 years (range; 16-86 years). The age was under 40 years in 21 (26.6%) patients. Whereas 68 patients underwent at least hysterectomy, 9 patients had organ sparing surgery. There was necrosis in 4 (5.1%) patients, atypia in 16 (20.3%) patients, and infiltrative tumor border in 34 (43%) patients. At least one mitosis per 10 high power fields was determined in 36 (45.5%) patients. The tumor involved at least part of the myometrium in 54 (68.3%) patients. Median follow-up time was 30 months (range; 3-296 months). Recurrence was determined in 5 (6.3%) patients. The disease free survival (DFS) was significantly related only to surgery type. None of the pathologic features were associated with DFS. The 5-year DFS was 86% and 96% in patients who underwent organ sparing surgery or not, respectively (p=0.038). CONCLUSION: The accurate pathologic diagnosis of UTROSCT has great value in shaping surgical management and management during the follow-up period. Organ sparing surgery was related to poor DFS. Although recurrence is rare, it should be kept in mind for patients with UTROSCT.

AB  - Recent randomized trials have shown that completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is not required in all patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) who will receive radiation therapy. Although routine intraoperative pathologic assessment (IPA) becomes unnecessary and less indicated by breast surgeons in the United States and some European countries, it is still widely used all around the world. In this prospective study, the feasibility of intraoperative nodal palpation (INP) as opposed to IPA of the SLN has been analyzed. Between March 2014 and June 2015, 305 patients with clinical T1-2/N0 breast cancer from two different breast clinics (cohort A; [n = 225] and cohort B; [n = 80]) who underwent any breast surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were included in this study. Surgeons evaluated the SLNs by manual palpation before sending for IPA, and findings compared with the final pathology. The positive predictive values (PPV) of INP and IPA were 81.8% and 97.9%, respectively, whereas the negative predictive values (NPV) of INP and IPA were 83% and 92.4%. The accuracies of INP and IPA were 82.6% and 94.1%, respectively. If patients with SLNB including micrometastasis were also considered in the final pathologic assessment (FPA) (-) group that would not require a further axillary dissection, the revised NPV of INP and FPA were found to be 92.6% and 98.1%, respectively. The revised accuracy of INP also found to be increase to 86.9%. Our study, which is the only prospective one about palpation of dissected SLNs in the literature, suggests that INP can help to identify patients who do not need ALND, which encourages omitting IPA in cT1-2 N0 breast cancer.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of borax (BX) against heavy metal exposure on the transcriptional and biochemical reaction in vivo and alleviating effect on gill and liver tissues of rainbow trout. Due to this aim, fish were fed with different level of BX and/or copper (Cu) (1.25, 2.5 and 5mg/kg of BX; 500 and 1000mg/kg of Cu) for 21.days in pre- and co-treatment options. The transcriptional parameters [(heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70), and cytochromes P450 (cyp1a), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT))], antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT and GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and caspase-3 levels were investigated in different tissues samples of treated and control fish. Our results revealed that antioxidant enzyme activity was increased and levels of 8-OHdG, Caspase-3 and MDA were decreased in the BX and BX combined groups as compared to the copper combination group and to copper-only application during pre- and co-treatment (p<0.05). Similarly, hsp70 and cyp1a gene expressions were decreased after treatment with BX. As conclusion, we suggest that borax itself is not an antioxidant it supportes antioxidant defense mechanism of fish disrupted by heavy metals.

AB  - BACKGROUND Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression may have role on recurrence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with positive surgical margin(s). OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the role of genetic expression changes of EGFR on recurrence rates in patients in follow up with surgically excised BCC with positive surgical margin(s). METHODS: Thirty-four surgical margin-positive BCC lesions that were closely followed up without an immediate reoperation were included in this study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed from the both healthy and tumoral tissue samples. RESULTS: EGFR was expressed at a significantly higher rate in tumoral tissues compared to healthy tissues (p<0,05). In patients with recurrence lesions, EGFR expression was 6,66 times higher compared to patients with non-recurrent. Also, there was statistically significant difference EGFR expression for infiltrative subtypes (p<0,05). CONCLUSION: Our study focuses on the role of EGFR overexpression specifically and outcomes for recurrent and infiltrative subtyped lesions are significant for both clinic and pathogenesis of BCC. Similar studies have to be performed with high numbered patient groups.

AB  - Background It is unknown whether renal pathology lesions in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) correlate with renal outcomes over decades of follow-up. Methods: In 1130 patients of the original Validation Study of the Oxford Classification for IgA Nephropathy (VALIGA) cohort, we studied the relationship between the MEST score (mesangial hypercellularity, M; endocapillary hypercellularity, E; segmental glomerulosclerosis, S; tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis, T), crescents (C) and other histological lesions with both a combined renal endpoint [50% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) loss or kidney failure] and the rate of eGFR decline over a follow-up period extending to 35 years [median 7 years (interquartile range 4.1-10.8)]. Results: In this extended analysis, M1, S1 and T1-T2 lesions as well as the whole MEST score were independently related with the combined endpoint (P < 0.01), and there was no effect modification by age for these associations, suggesting that they may be valid in children and in adults as well. Only T lesions were associated with the rate of eGFR loss in the whole cohort, whereas C showed this association only in patients not treated with immunosuppression. In separate prognostic analyses, the whole set of pathology lesions provided a gain in discrimination power over the clinical variables alone, which was similar at 5 years (+2.0%) and for the whole follow-up (+1.8%). A similar benefit was observed for risk reclassification analyses (+2.7% and +2.4%). Conclusion: Long-term follow-up analyses of the VALIGA cohort showed that the independent relationship between kidney biopsy findings and the risk of progression towards kidney failure in IgAN remains unchanged across all age groups and decades after the renal biopsy.

The disease can essentially be divided into cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). In adults, SM is diagnosed in most cases and manifests as either indolent or advanced disease. Patients with advanced SM have an unfavorable prognosis with reduced survival. However, so far, little is known about the prevalence of various categories of SM and about prognostic factors. In an attempt to learn more about the behavior and evolution of various forms of CM and SM, the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM) initiated a mastocytosis registry in 2012. In this article, the set up and start phase of this registry are described. Until 2018, more than 3000 patients from 12 countries and 25 centers have been enrolled. In a majority of all patients, robust follow-up data and relevant clinical end points are available. Using this data set, a series of registry projects have been launched, with the aim to validate previously identified diagnostic and prognostic variables and to identify new disease-related and patient-related parameters in various forms of mastocytosis. Moreover, the core data set of the registry will be useful to establish multiparametric scoring systems through which prognostication and individualized management of patients with mastocytosis should improve in the foreseeable future.

AB  - The study aims to assess the effects of antibiotics (ABs), which are typically used in spinal infection prophylaxis, on the formation of epidural fibrosis (EF). Specifically, we investigated the effect of rifamycin and gentamycin on EF formation in laminectomized rats. Thirty-two rats were randomly and equally divided into four groups as follows: laminectomy and physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (control); laminectomy and rifamycin; laminectomy and gentamicin; and laminectomy and a mixture of rifamycin and gentamicin. Laminectomy was performed on L1 and L2 vertebrae in all rats. One month after spinal surgery, spinal tissue samples surrounding the laminectomy were cut with a microtome and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome. The histopathological analysis included examining the extent of EF, fibroblast cell density, and cartilage and bone regeneration. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 program (SPSS IBM, Turkey). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. EF value differences between the AB treatment groups and the control group were statistically significant (p = 0.030). Specifically, binary comparisons indicated that the EF value was significantly higher in the rifamycin group than that in the control group (p = 0.003; p < 0.05). Our study suggests that locally applied ABs, especially rifamycin, should be diluted before administration to the epidural space.

AB  - Protein-losing enteropathy may develop as a complication of a wide spectrum of diseases. Three cases of giardiasis that presented with acute onset of hypoalbuminemia were documented, and resolution of protein loss after treatment was also confirmed. Thus, chronic enteric infections should be considered as an etiology of severe intestinal protein loss, particularly in children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE This study investigates the multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) characteristics and pathologic outcome of wedge-shaped lesions observed on T2-weighted images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer underwent preoperative 3-T MRI before undergoing radical prostatectomy. Two radiologists worked in consensus to mark wedge-shaped regions of hypointensity on T2-weighted images and assess their appearance on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (to determine the degree of hypointensity) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI (DCE-MRI) (to assess whether they showed early enhancement). The pathologic outcome of wedge-shaped lesions was assessed by matching MR images with whole-mount histologic specimens retrospectively. The difference in quantitative ADC values between malignant and benign wedge-shaped lesions was assessed using a t test. RESULTS: Thirty-five wedge-shaped regions were identified, 12 (34%) of which were found be malignant. Most malignant wedge-shaped regions were highly hypointense (10/12; 83%) on ADC maps and showed early enhancement on DCE-MRI (7/12; 58%). However, benign wedge-shaped lesions were predominantly mildly hypointense (13/23; 57%) on ADC maps and showed no early enhancement (15/23; 65%). Histologic correlates of the benign wedge-shaped regions showed prostatitis (acute inflammation [7/23; 30%] or chronic inflammation [9/23; 39%]), hemosiderin-laden macrophages (6/23; 26%), prominent blood vessels (7/23; 30%), intraluminal blood (6/23; 26%), and nonspecific atrophy (6/23; 26%). The mean (+/- SD) quantitative ADC value of malignant wedge-shaped regions (1.13 +/- 0.11 mum(2)/ms) was significantly lower (p = 0.0001) than that of benign wedge-shaped regions (1.52 +/- 0.27 mum(2)/ms). CONCLUSION: This study shows that a greater percentage of wedge-shaped features are malignant than was previously thought. Of importance, mpMRI (specifically, ADC maps) can distinguish between malignant and benign wedge-shaped features.

AB  - BACKGROUND Epidural fibrosis is a major problem after spine surgery, with some patients having recurrent symptoms secondary to excessive formation of scar tissue resulting in neurologic compression. We used a rat laminectomy model to determine if topical application of boric acid could be helpful in the prevention of epidural fibrosis. METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to 2 control and 2 experimental groups (n = 8 for each group). The negative control group received no surgery, and the positive control group underwent laminectomy only. Experimental groups were classified according to the study agents applied onto the dura mater after laminectomy at the L3 level: 2.5% boric acid solution and 5% boric acid solution. The extent of epidural fibrosis was assessed 4 weeks later macroscopically and histopathologically. RESULTS: Boric acid reduced epidural fibrosis in rats after laminectomy. The effect of 5% boric acid solution was more pronounced (P < 0.05) compared with the 2.5% solution. CONCLUSIONS: The antifibrotic effect of boric acid solution for the prevention of epidural fibrosis suggests that boric acid should be further evaluated in future studies for the prevention of epidural fibrosis.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Thymus praecox subsp. skorpilii var. skorpilii (syn. Thymus praecox subsp. jankae (Celak.) Jalas) is consumed as a Turkish folk medicine for the treatment of spasm, sore throat and shortness of breath, also having strong antioxidant activity and the leaves of the plant have been utilized for the treatment of diabetes as the decoction in Turkey. AIM OF THE STUDY: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of antidiabetic action of Thymus praecox subsp. skorpilii var. skorpilii methanolic extract (TPSE) on streptozotocin (STZ)/nicotinamide (NA)-induced type 2 diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups; control, diabetes, TPSE (100mg/kg b.w, p.o.) and metformin group (400mg/kg b.w, p.o.). Diabetes was established in all groups except control group by 55mg/kg STZ (i.p.) for once 15min after 100mg/kg NA injection. 3 days after STZ/NA injection, treatments were administered for three weeks and then rats were decapitated; tissue and blood samples were obtained for measuring the level of glucose transporters (both GLUTs and sodium glucose co-transporters (SGLTs)), enzymes related to glucose (Hexokinase (HK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), alpha-glucosidase) and lipid metabolism (Acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase (ACC)), AST, ALT, creatinine, insulin, anti-inflammatory (IL-10) and inflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) cytokines, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Histopathological alterations of the pancreas were examined. RESULTS: After three weeks of treatment, TPSE has exhibited a significant reduction of plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokines. Besides, TPSE treatment elevated plasma insulin levels and normalized blood glucose levels. Moreover, it improved the values of AMPK in liver and GLP-1 in pancreas. Increased alpha-glucosidase, PEPCK, GLUT-2 and SGLTs levels with the induction of diabetes considerably lowered with TPSE treatment. Especially on SGLT-2, TPSE achieved a more prominent decrease. After the atrophy in Langerhans islets due to diabetes induction, treatment was found to prevent the damage of islets. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings presented here, it has been concluded that TPSE has marked antidiabetic effects through various pathways on STZ/NA-induced diabetic rats and it may potentially be used as an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Further research on isolation of the bioactive components is underway.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The reasons behind the removal of the biopsy tract in osteosarcomas are not well known, and studies about tumor seeding in the biopsy tract have generated conflicting results. This study is designed to evaluate the presence and possible clinical significance of tumor cell seeding in the biopsy tract of osteosarcomas. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 55 cases of osteosarcomas for tumor cell seeding and other clinical and pathologic prognostic parameters. RESULTS: Eleven cases (20%) involved microscopic tumor foci in the biopsy tract. The higher local recurrence rates (P = 0.005) and worse recurrence-free survivals ( P = 0.009) were observed in patients with tumor cell foci in the biopsy tract. Mitotic rate, tumor cell pleomorphism, and matrix production in main tumor foci were higher in cases with tumor seeding ( P = 0.047, P = 0.012, and P = 0.005, respectively) CONCLUSIONS: Tumor seeding in the biopsy tract is a fact in osteosarcomas. The higher local recurrence rates are more likely to occur in cases with tumor seeding.

AB  - The proteasomal system is responsible for the turnover of damaged proteins. Because of its important functions in oncogenesis, inhibiting the proteasomal system is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Bortezomib (BTZ) is the first proteasome inhibitor approved by FDA for clinical applications. However neuropathic side effects are dose limiting for BTZ as many other chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore second-generation proteasome inhibitors have been developed including carfilzomib (CFZ). Aim of the present work was investigating the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy triggered by the proteasome inhibitor BTZ and comparing the pathways affected by BTZ and CFZ, respectively. Neural stem cells, isolated from the cortex of E14 mouse embryos, were treated with BTZ and CFZ and mass spectrometry was used to compare the global protein pool of treated cells. BTZ was shown to cause more severe cytoskeletal damage, which is crucial in neural cell integrity. Excessive protein carbonylation and actin filament destabilization were also detected following BTZ treatment that was lower following CFZ treatment. Our data on cytoskeletal proteins, chaperone system, and protein oxidation may explain the milder neurotoxic effects of CFZ in clinical applications.

AB  - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided pancreatic cyst ablation with alcohol lavage or paclitaxel-based regimens are investigative modalities. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of EUS-guided pancreatic cyst ablation with alcohol lavage or paclitaxel-based regimens. A systematic review of computerized bibliographic databases was carried out for studies of EUS-guided pancreatic cyst ablation with alcohol lavage or paclitaxel-based regimens from January 1980 to February 2018. EUS-guided cyst ablation-related outcomes (cyst resolution) and complications. Data were extracted from six studies (N=207 patients) for EUS-guided cyst ablation with alcohol lavage and eight studies (N=347 patients) for EUS-guided cyst ablation with paclitaxel-based regimens. The pooled proportion of patients with complete cyst resolution was 68/207 (32.8%) for EUS-guided cyst ablation with alcohol lavage and 221/347 (63.6%) for EUS-guided cyst ablation with paclitaxel. Postablation adverse events with EUS-guided ablation with alcohol lavage were 44/207 (21.7%), and those with EUS-guided ablation with paclitaxel-based regimens were 52/347 (15%). Limitations of this study are because of the variability in study design and regimens tested, paucity of randomized trials, and differences in pancreatic cyst types receiving treatment. EUS-guided cyst ablation appears to be effective and safe. The effect on pancreatic cancer incidence is unknown; EUS-guided pancreatic cyst ablation modalities require further improvement and validation to determine their role in the treatment of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.

AB  - Introduction Tetracosactide is an engineered peptide that applies the same biological impacts as the endogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone. Previous studies indicated that tetracosactide has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neurotrophic activity. In this study, we hypothesized that tetracosactide may have protective effects in spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury. Material and methods: Rabbits were randomized into the accompanying four groups of eight animals each: group 1 (control), group 2 (ischemia), group 3 (methylprednisolone) and group 4 (tetracosactide). In the control group, just a laparotomy was performed. In the various groups, the spinal cord ischemia model was made by the impediment of the aorta only caudal to the renal vein. Neurological assessment was conducted with the Tarlov scoring system. Levels of myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and catalase were analyzed, similar to the activities of xanthine oxidase and caspase-3. Histopathological and ultrastructural assessments were additionally performed. Results: After ischemia-reperfusion injury, increments were found in the tissue myeloperoxidase levels (p < 0.001), malondialdehyde levels (p < 0.001), xanthine oxidase action (p < 0.001) and caspase-3 movement (p < 0.001). Conversely, both serum and tissue catalase levels were diminished (p < 0.001 for both). After the administration of tetracosactide, declines were seen in the tissue myeloperoxidase levels (p < 0.001), malondialdehyde levels (p = 0.003), xanthine oxidase action (p < 0.001) and caspase-3 movement (p < 0.001). Conversely, both the serum and tissue catalase levels were expanded (p < 0.001). Besides, tetracosactide treatment indicated enhanced results related to the histopathological scores (p < 0.001), the ultra-structural score (p = 0.008) and the Tarlov scores (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The findings showed for the first time that tetracosactide shows significant neuroprotective activity against ischemia-reperfusion injury of the spinal cord.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to define histopathological features of giant cell tumor of bone, especially accompanying fibrohistiocytic or aneurysmal bone cyst like components, in the light of our institutions experience. METHODS: A total of 120 cases (64 females and 56 males; mean age: 36.2 (12-80)) with 'GCT' diagnosed between the years 1996-2016 were included in this retrospective analysis. Cases were evaluated according to clinical features such as age, gender, localization, recurrence, metastasis and histopathological features. RESULTS: Tumors were localized most frequently at proximal tibia and distal femur, respectively. In 11 cases areas rich in fibrohistiocytic component and in 20 cases aneurysmal bone cyst like component were observed. In 2 cases both components were present. Twenty three cases recurred. In 1 case which was primarily located at calcaneus, tumor metastasized to lung 4 years later during follow-up. CONCLUSION: GCT can be confused with other tumor or tumor-like lesions involving giant cells. Secondary changes such as fibrohistiocytic or aneurysmal bone cyst-like components and coagulation necrosis were frequently seen in conventional giant cell tumor of bone. For tumors having prominent fibrohistiocytic and/or aneurysmal bone cyst-like components, in order to detect characteristic areas representing GCT, additional sampling is essential. Although secondary histopathological changes do not appear to affect clinical outcome, these features are important in differential diagnosis. Approximately one fifth of GCT cases show recurrence and sacrum and foot bones were the most frequent sites for recurrence. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, diagnostic study.

AB  - The modern classification of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors relies mainly on immunohistochemistry for pituitary transcription factors, hormones, and other biomarkers, including low molecular weight cytokeratins. The transcription factor GATA2 is required for development of gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs but has not been used for classification of pituitary tumors. Because of genomic paralogy of GATA2 and GATA3, we postulated that GATA3 immunohistochemistry may detect GATA2 in the adenohypophysis. We examined 151 tumors originating from Ondokuz Mayis University, Turkey (n = 83) and University Health Network, Canada (n = 68). Initially, 83 tumors (26 gonadotroph, 24 somatotroph, 17 corticotroph, 12 lactotroph, 2 poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumors that expressed TSH and 2 null cell tumors) from Ondokuz Mayis University were investigated with the GATA3 monoclonal antibody L50-823. Retrospective review of the files of University Health Network identified 68 tumors (43 gonadotroph, 3 somatotroph, 2 lactotroph, 1 mammosomatotroph, 9 corticotroph, 7 poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumors with TSH expression, 2 plurihormonal tumors with TSH expression and 1 null cell tumor) that were examined with the same GATA3 antibody and served as a validation cohort. All somatotroph, lactotroph and mammosomatotroph tumors and the null cell tumors were negative for GATA3. Sixty-eight (98.5%) gonadotroph tumors were positive for GATA3; 64 had diffuse reactivity. Two plurihormonal tumors with TSH expression and eight (88.8%) poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumors with variable TSH expression were positive for GATA3. One of 26 (3.8%) corticotroph tumors was diffusely positive for GATA3. This study shows that GATA3 immunoreactivity is characteristic of pituitary gonadotroph and TSH-producing tumors. This finding expands the pattern of transcription factors that are used to classify adenohypophysial tumors and is important in the differential diagnosis of sellar tumors, as GATA3 expression is also a feature of primary sellar paragangliomas as well as carcinomas that may metastasize to the sella.

AB  - Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a zoonotic and opportunistic pathogen, can cause latent infection, especially in lagomorphs. Nowadays, this member of the Eukaryotes has drawn significant attention in the fields of veterinary and public health. The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of infection in a New Zealand rabbit farm that has a clinical history of neurological manifestations including head tilt ataxia, aggressiveness, seizures, and circling and rotational movements around the body length axis, but the general conditions and food intake were normal. Blood samples were taken from 42 breeding rabbits and researched for E. cuniculi antibodies. Out of that, 25 (59%) animals resulted positive against the pathogen. The rabbit was found to be seropositive for E. cuniculi antibodies, but negative for Toxoplasma gondii and Listeria monocytogenes antibodies. Hematological and serum biochemical parameters were measured at reference intervals. No brain tissue impairment was observed the computed tomography (CT) scan. As a result of these histopathological findings, the brain cortex presented severe neuronal degeneration and partial myelin loss, with reactive diffuse gliosis against the parasite spores was observed to the histopathology. These results are possibly related to the early stage of infection because the parasitic infestation comprise long time spreading. E. cuniculi DNA was detected on brain tissues using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and it partial DNA sequence was identified as E. cuniculi genotype I.

AB  - Androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles are human pregnancies with no embryos and affect 1 in every 1,400 pregnancies. They have mostly androgenetic monospermic genomes with all the chromosomes originating from a haploid sperm and no maternal chromosomes. Androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles were described in 1977, but how they occur has remained an open question. We identified bi-allelic deleterious mutations in MEI1, TOP6BL/C11orf80, and REC114, with roles in meiotic double-strand breaks formation in women with recurrent androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles. We investigated the occurrence of androgenesis in Mei1-deficient female mice and discovered that 8% of their oocytes lose all their chromosomes by extruding them with the spindles into the first polar body. We demonstrate that Mei1(-/-) oocytes are capable of fertilization and 5% produce androgenetic zygotes. Thus, we uncover a meiotic abnormality in mammals and a mechanism for the genesis of androgenetic zygotes that is the extrusion of all maternal chromosomes and their spindles into the first polar body.

AB  - Pachydermodactyly is a rare digital fibromatosis, characterized by painless, fusiform swelling in proximal interphalangeal joints. Since it may be misdiagnosed as inflammatory arthritis, it is important to call physicians' attention to this rarely seen condition to avoid unnecessary immunosuppressive treatment. Hereby, we present a case of a pachydermodactyly that had been previously followed-up and treated as an inflammatory arthritis for 4 years. We describe the clinical, radiological, and dermoscopic features of the case.

AB  - Schwannomas (also called neurilemmomas) are slow-growing nerve sheath tumors derived from Schwann cells. However, intraosseous schwannoma is a rare entity with an incidence of only 0.2% in overall primary bone tumors. The purpose of this case report is to present a case of an intraosseous schwannoma of the calcaneus. A 35-year-old woman was admitted to our outpatients' clinics with a complaint of long-time right heel pain (for approximately eight months). After a suspicious cystic lesion was observed on the patient's plain radiograph examination, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The MRI showed a 22 x 20 mm intraosseous cystic lesion at the posterior part of the calcaneus. Extended curettage and iliac bone grafting were performed. In the presence of postoperative histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination, histopathologic diagnosis of the patient was reported as intraosseous schwannoma. After 4 weeks of nonweight-bearing, she completely recovered with no pain. In conclusion, intraosseous schwannoma of the calcaneus must be kept in mind for patients who have chronic heel pain.

AB  - Introduction Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and a major significant health problem amongst men in the world. Radical prostatectomy with open, laparoscopic and robotic techniques is the gold standard treatment for localized and local advanced disease. There are some risk factors including gleason score, T stage and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level to predict the biochemical recurrence. We investigated the association with biochemical recurrence and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in patients who were treated with open radical prostatectomy. Material and methods: The expression of TMPRSS2:ERG was defined as positive (Group 1) and negative (Group 2). The positive staining of the patients is classified into three groups; weak positive, moderate positive and strong positive. In the statistical analyses; chi squared test and Mann Whitney U were used and p <0.05 was defined as statistical significance. Results: The present study includes 87 patients, 32 and 55 patients were in group 1 and 2 respectively. The mean age of the patients was 62.81 +5.55 and 64.45 +5.18 in the groups without significant difference. Extraprostatic extension was reported in 27 patients; 11 of these patients were in group 1 and 16 patients were in group 2 (p = 0.60). Biochemical recurrence was detected in 15 patients. Of these patients, 5 were in group 1 and 10 were in group 2 (p = 0.76). Conclusions: The current study found no association between TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and biochemical recurrence and unfavourable pathological results in Turkish patients. Further research including a large number of patients from different regions of Turkey is needed to investigate the ERG status and biochemical recurrence for patients.

AB  - To our best knowledge, no case of a tumor that was incidentally detected during living donor hepatectomy (LDH) has been reported in the English language medical literature. We present two cases in which grade I neuroendocrine tumors (NET) were incidentally detected during our twelve-year LDH experience. First Case: A 26-year-old male underwent LDH for his brother suffering from HBV-related chronic liver disease (CLD). After right lobe LDH, intestinal length was measured as part of a study concerning the relationship between small intestinal lengths and surgical procedure. At this stage, a mass lesion with a size of 10 mm x 10 mm was detected on the antimesenteric surface, approximately 90 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. A wedge resection with primary intestinal anastomosis was performed. Second Case: A 29-year-old male underwent right lobe LDH for his father with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related CLD. An abdominal exploration immediately prior to the closure of the incision revealed that the appendix vermiformis was edematous and had firmness with a size of 8-10 mm at its tip. An appendectomy was performed. The pathological examinations of the specimens of both patients revealed grade 1 NET. In conclusion, even if patients undergoing LDH are healthy individuals, whole abdominal cavity should be gently palpated and all findings recorded after completing laparotomy. Suspected masses or lesions should be confirmed by frozen section examination. Such an approach would avert potential medicolegal issues.

AB  - BACKGROUND We aimed to investigate the effect of systemic isotretinoin therapy on normal and wounded nasal septal mucosa histopathologically in an experimental rabbit model. METHODS: Circular mucosal defect with a 7 mm diameter was made in the left septum of 12 New Zealand white rabbits. The rabbits were divided into two groups (six rabbits in each group) oral isotretinoin was given with olive oil at the operation day to the first group. The control group was only oil given group. The harvested septum mucosas were divided into four groups (1-wounded-drug given side, 2-unwounded and drug-given side, 3-wounded-control and 4-unwounded-control side). The diameter of the defect, mucosal thickness, epithelial thickness, ciliated cell level, goblet cell level and inflammation were evaluated every week for 4 weeks. RESULTS: At both wounded and normal side, thinning of normal respiratory ciliated epithelium was observed in the postoperative period. In study group at the wounded side; mean mucosal thickness was measured 139.66 micro (+/- 26.24), and in the control group, mean mucosal thickness was 238.33 micro (+/- 39.7) at the wounded side. (p < 0.001). The difference between the groups in thickness of normal septal mucosa was also statistically significant (p = 0.016) [190 micro (+/- 14.6) and 256.66 micro (+/- 44.66)]. The average cilia level was observed 1.16 in the wounded study group, while the average level was 2.33 in the wounded control group (p = 0.012). Average score measurements of the regenerated mucosa suggested that isotretinoin-given wounded animals have reduced goblet cell recovery, compared to the control both on the regenerated and unwounded mucosas (p = 0.007, p = 0.002, respectively). Inflammation was significantly higher in the wounded isotretinoin group (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Oral isotretinoin has negative effects on epithelial and ciliary regeneration, significantly reduces mucosal thickness and goblet cell counts of the normal and regenerated mucosa, causes severe inflammation and significant reactive changes.

AB  - The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of Listeria spp. in stray dogs in the Kayseri province of Turkey. In addition, serotyping, genotyping and virulence gene analysis of the isolated Listeria spp. were performed and their pathogenicity and antibacterial susceptibility were investigated. The study included 80 rectal swaps taken from 80 stray dogs of different ages and gender that were sheltered in the Kayseri Municipal Dog Shelter. Listeria selective broth and Listeria selective agar were used for the isolation of Listeria spp. and the isolates were identified using a Microbact 12L (Oxoid, England) identification test kit. 16S rDNA sequencing and species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed for molecular identification of the isolates, multiplex PCR and a serological test were performed for serotyping, and PCR was used for virulence gene analysis. For determining the pathogenicity of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua isolates, a total of 100 mice (50 pregnant and 50 non-pregnant) were used. The mice were infected intraperitoneally; the inoculation dose was 1x10(9)CFU/mL and 0.2mL was used for each animal. Tissue samples obtained from infected mice were processed for the re-isolation of the Listeria spp. and then stained with hematoxylin eosin and Brown-Brenn Gram stain. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by the disk diffusion method. Listeria spp. were isolated from 5 (6.25%) of the 80 fecal samples. While 1 of the isolates was identified as L. monocytogenes, 4 of them were identified as L. innocua. Serotyping by serological and molecular methods revealed the isolate of L. monocytogenes to be serotype 1/2a. According to the phylogenetic trees, L. innocua and L. monocytogenes strains were clustered in different groups. The L. monocytogenes isolate was positive for all virulence genes tested. All L. innocua isolates were positive for the plcB gene. While all L. innocua isolates were negative for the lin1068 gene, 3 L. innocua isolates were found to be positive for the lin0558 gene. In mice infected with L. monocytogenes, pathological findings were observed in the uterus, intestines, pancreas, and heart. In mice infected with L. innocua, pathological findings were observed in the stomach, intestines and spleen. L. monocytogenes- or L. innocua-related infections or other inflammatory reactions were not observed in the brains of infected animals. On histopathological examination with Gram stain, an abundance of Listeria spp. was observed in the lesions of the liver, spleen, uterus, and kidney. Moreover, while abortion was observed in all animals infected with L. monocytogenes, it was not observed in any of the animals infected with L. innocua. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that all 5 isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin G, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and were resistant to nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and cefuroxime sodium. Considering also the pathogenicity of the isolated microorganisms, it can be suggested that stray dogs as carriers of Listeria spp. are a significant risk to public health. As L. innocua isolates, which are considered apathogenic, led to the occurrence of lesions similar to those caused by L. monocytogenes, detailed studies on the pathogenesis of L. innocua infections caused by L. innocua isolates recovered from various sources are required.

AB  - Smokers have a risk of developing periodontal disease. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) play a significant role in periodontal tissue destruction. In this study possible relationship between smoking and gingival tissue expression of gelatinases in chronic periodontitis patients relative to periodontally healthy subjects was investigated. Forty chronic periodontitis patients (20 smokers and 20 non-smokers) and forty periodontally healthy subjects (20 smokers and 20 non-smokers) were enrolled. The clinical periodontal measurements recorded, and gingival tissues harvested after that. After histologic evaluation, matrix metalloproteinases -2 and -9 expressions were analyzed immunohistochemically. In nonsmokers, higher expression of metalloproteinases -2 and -9 detected in chronic periodontitis group compared to the periodontally healthy group. In the smoker chronic periodontitis group, the expression of metalloproteinases-2 was lower than nonsmoker chronic periodontitis group. Statistically significant differences detected between smoker and nonsmoker periodontally healthy groups in metalloproteinases-2 expression. For metalloproteinases-9 expression, smoker chronic periodontitis group has lower values than nonsmoker chronic periodontitis group. In periodontally healthy group smokers showed higher metalloproteinases -9 expressions than non- smokers. Present findings support the role of gelatinases in chronic periodontitis pathogenesis. Based on the current results we conclude that smoking alters the expression of gelatinases in gingival tissues.

AB  - AIM Juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) have been recently reclassified into clinico-serological subgroups. Myopathological correlates of the subgroups are incompletely understood. METHODS: We studied muscle biopsies from 101 children with clinically and serologically-defined juvenile IIM from the UK JDM Cohort and Biomarker Study by applying the international JDM score tool, myopathological review, and C5b-9 complement analysis. RESULTS: Autoantibody data were available for 90/101 cases with 18/90 cases positive for anti-TIF1gamma, 15/90 anti-NXP2, 11/90 anti-MDA5, 5/90 anti-Mi2, and 6/90 anti-PmScl. JDM biopsy severity scores were consistently low in the anti-MDA5 group, high in the anti-Mi2 group, and widely distributed in the other groups. Biopsies were classified histologically as perifascicular atrophy (22/101), macrophage-rich necrosis (6/101), scattered necrosis (2/101), clustered necrosis (2/101), inflammatory fibre invasion (2/101), chronic myopathic change (1/101), diffuse endomysial macrophage infiltrates (40/101), and minimal change (24/101). MDA5 cases segregated with the minimal change group and showed no capillary C5b-9-deposition. The Mi2 group displayed high severity scores and a tendency towards sarcolemmal complement deposition. NXP2 and TIF1gamma groups showed a variety of pathologies with a high proportion of diffuse endomysial macrophage infiltrates and a high proportion of capillary C5b-9 deposition. CONCLUSION: We have shown that juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies have a spectrum of histopathological phenotypes and show distinct complement attack complex deposition patterns. Both correlate in some cases with the serological subtypes. Most cases do not show typical histological features associated with dermatomyositis (e.g. perifascicular atrophy). In contrast, more than half show relatively mild histopathological changes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM We aimed to examine the frequency and the characteristics of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-associated autoimmune hepatitis among pediatric patients with autoimmune hepatitis. METHODS: Immunostaining for IgG and IgG4 was performed in liver biopsies of 40 pediatric patients with autoimmune hepatitis. The patients with more than 10 IgG4-positive plasma cells/high-power field were defined as IgG4-associated autoimmune hepatitis. Clinic, laboratory, and histopathological results were compared between groups. RESULTS: Among the 40 pediatric patients, 34 patients were type 1 and 6 patients were type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. Six patients (15%), four of the type 1 and two of the type 2 autoimmune hepatitis patients, were diagnosed with IgG4-associated autoimmune hepatitis. Clinical, laboratory, and histopathological data were initially similar in both forms. There was a positive correlation between IgG4-positive plasma cell count and degree of portal (r: 0.406, P: 0.009) and lobular inflammation (r: 0.37, P: 0.019), grade of interface hepatitis (r: 0.33, P: 0.03), and fibrosis (r: 0.318, P: 0.046). Time required for normalization of liver transaminases and serum IgG level was significantly shorter in IgG4-associated autoimmune hepatitis (3.3 +/- 0.5 vs 6.6 +/- 3.5 for alanine aminotransferase, 3.7 +/- 0.8 vs 6.7 +/- 1.2 for aspartate aminotransferase, 4.3 +/- 1.2 vs 7.1 +/- 2.7 for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and 7.2 +/- 3.1 vs 12.8 +/- 4.5 for IgG). CONCLUSIONS: Immunoglobulin G4-associated autoimmune hepatitis can be found in pediatric age group and also in type 2 autoimmune hepatitis patients. As steroid response may be better in IgG4-associated autoimmune hepatitis, biopsy specimens should be evaluated for this entity at diagnosis.

AB  - In rheumatology practice, the risk of hepatotoxicity from medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, notably, and methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, and azathioprine is highly recognized by the rheumatologists. On the other hand, hepatotoxicity is neither a commonly expected nor a well-known side effect of cyclophosphamide (CYC) which is particularly used for vital organ involvements in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic vasculitis. Here we reported a 19-year-old case of SLE who, while on oral CYC treatment of 100 mg/day, was detected to have asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation and then developed acute hepatitis due to intravenously administered high-dose (1 g) CYC for neuro-lupus. Results of liver biopsy indicated drug-related toxicity. We discussed here with the other, although rare, cases available in the literature with an attempt to highlight the risk of hepatotoxicity and acute hepatitis due to CYC.

AB  - OBJECTIVES In this study, our aim was to identify the possible effects of montelukast sodium (ML) on the prevention of experimentally induced myringosclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight female Wistar albino rats were used and they were divided into four groups randomly. Tympanic membranes (TM) of all animals were perforated and then group 1 received no treatment (control group), group 2 was treated with a topical saline solution, group 3 received topically ML and group 4 received orally ML. On the 15th day, all animals were euthanized. Tympanic membranes were evaluated otomicroscopically and histopathologically. RESULTS: The histopathological findings, compared against a control and saline groups, showed the topically and orally ML groups had statistically significant differences of degree of myringosclerosis (p < 0.002) and median thickness of the TMs (p < 0.001). Suppression of inflammation was statistically significant only in the oral ML treatment group (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: Oral and topically administration of ML reduced myringosclerosis formation in myringotomies rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To determine, in a multi-ethnic/racial, prospective SLE inception cohort, the frequency, attribution, clinical and autoantibody associations with lupus psychosis and the short and long-term outcome as assessed by physicians and patients. METHODS: Patients were evaluated annually for 19 neuropsychiatric (NP) events including psychosis. SLE disease activity 2000, SLICC/ACR damage index and SF-36 scores were collected. Time to event and linear regressions were used as appropriate. RESULTS: Of 1,826 SLE patients, 88.8% were female, 48.8% Caucasian. The mean+/-SD age was 35.1+/-13.3 years, disease duration 5.6+/-4.2 months and follow-up 7.4+/-4.5 years. There were 31 psychotic events in 28/1,826 (1.53%) patients and most [(26/28; 93%)] had a single event. In the majority of patients [20/25; (80%)] and events [28/31; (90%)] psychosis was attributed to SLE, usually within 3 years of SLE diagnosis. Positive associations [hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval [HR (95%CI)] with lupus psychosis were prior SLE NP events [3.59, (1.16, 11.14), male sex [3.0, (1.20, 7.50)], younger age at SLE diagnosis [(per 10 years younger), 1.45 (1.01, 2.07)] and African ancestry [4.59 (1.79, 11.76)]. By physician assessment most psychotic events resolved by the second annual visit following onset, in parallel with an improvement in patient reported SF-36 summary and subscale scores. CONCLUSION: Psychosis is an infrequent manifestation of NPSLE. Generally, it occurs early after SLE onset and has a significant negative impact on health status. As determined by patient and physician report, the short and long term outlook is good for most patients, though careful follow-up is required. This article is protected by copyright.

AB  - Solitary cecal diverticulitis is a rare clinical condition. Like diverticulitis in other segments of the colon, it requires immediate surgical intervention if it is causing complications. Solitary cecal diverticulitis may be misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis, since it causes right lower quadrant pain, or as a cecal tumor or inflammatory bowel disease, due to an intraoperative appearance resembling an inflammatory mass. Four patients with solitary cecum diverticulitis presenting with acute right lower quadrant pain are discussed in this report. Three patients underwent surgery with a preliminary diagnosis of acute appendicitis or cecal tumor, and 1 patient was diagnosed with cecal diverticulitis and treated medically. The treatment approach may change depending on a preoperative or intraoperative diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis. Therefore, in areas where this disease is uncommon, cecum diverticulitis should not be forgotten in the differential diagnosis of acute right lower quadrant pain or inflammatory bowel mass.

AB  - OBJECTIVE A unilateral sinonasal mass is a common pathology in ear, nose, and throat clinical practice. However, it may be confused with early stage inflammatory pathologies. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic histopathological, clinical, and radiological criteria for a unilateral nasal mass. METHODS: The present study examined the clinical and pathological profiles of unilateral sinonasal masses observed in patients at an ear, nose, and throat clinic in Istanbul between January 2008 and January 2016. During the period of this retrospective study, 195 patients presented with a single-sided sinonasal mass (males: 130, females: 65; age range: 9-93 years). The data analyzed were obtained from patient records. RESULTS: The single-sided sinonasal mass was benign in 187 (95.9%) cases and malignant in 8 (4.1%) cases. Inflammatory polyps (81.03%) were the most frequent benign finding. Squamous cell carcinoma (1.54%) was the most commonly diagnosed malignant lesion. CONCLUSION: A single-sided sinonasal mass is commonly detected by otorhinolaryngologists. Although most often the diagnosis is inflammatory nasal polyposis, the risk of malignancy should not be overlooked. For this reason, careful endoscopic examination should be performed, all lesions should undergo a pathological examination, and it should be kept in mind that neoplastic disease can occur at any age and may be associated with many symptoms.

AB  - Neuroendocrine carcinoma is one of the uncommonly seen pathologies of the urinary bladder. Macroscopic hematuria is frequently encountered symptom in patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma. We report a 45-year-old man with left solitary kidney and oliguria for five days the development of acute renal failure (ARF) with the impaired general condition. The underlying cause being identified as pure type large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder. Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder is an uncommon fatal tumor. No macroscopic hematuria or urological symptom was observed in our case. Advanced ectasia was not observed in the kidney, and the patient's clinical status was complicated with ARF. It must not be forgotten that in some bladder tumors, the patient's general condition may be impaired without urological symptoms.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate whether hesperidin and chrysin antioxidants have protective effects on renal injury induced by colistin in rats. Renal lipid peroxidation, total glutathione (GSH) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) enzyme activities, serum urea and creatinine levels, as well as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels were determined. Injuries to the proximal and distal tubules were determined using histopathological and double immunohistochemistry examinations. The results showed that hesperidin and chrysin significantly decreased the levels of MDA and inflammatory parameters and significantly increased GSH, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px levels against colistin-induced renal injury. The results also showed that cystatin C and calbindin D28K immunopositivities significantly increased through hesperidin and chrysin treatment. Hesperidin and chrysin alleviated the renal injury induced by colistin via anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Thus, hesperidin and chrysin could attenuate colistin-induced nephrotoxicity via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Addition of hesperidin or chrysin to the treatment protocol of colistin treatment might benefit patient treatment in terms of the prevention of colistin-induced renal injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM L-theanine is the unique amino acid found in tea plants, has antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities, and functions in mental concentration and sleep quality. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effects of L-theanine on doxorubicin (DOX, a chemotherapeutic agent) induced nephrotoxicity in rats, especially via GSH related enzymes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 300-400 g were randomly assigned into 4 groups (n = 8) and the substances were given intraperitoneally to them: Control group (saline for 5 days); Theanine group (200 mg/kg/day theanine for 5 days); DOX group (single dose of 20 mg/kg DOX); DOX + Theanine group (20 mg/kg DOX at first day and 200 mg/kg/day theanine for 5 days). Kidney tissues were evaluated by histopathological analysis. Serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine by spectrophotometrically; percentage of apoptosis indexes (AI%) in the tissues by TUNEL method; caspase-3 levels, reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG), gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST), nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-kB p65) by commercial kits; malondialdehyde (MDA) by spectrophotometrically were determined in plasma and kidney tissues. RESULTS: According to DOX group, the DOX + Theanine group has much lower tissue and plasma GSSG, GGT1, NF-kappaB p65 levels and tissue AI%, whereas significantly higher GSH levels and GPx, GR, GST activities (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It is suggested that L-theanine may have protective effects by enhancing effects on the antioxidant system of GSH and GSH-related enzymes against DOX-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. But this finding needs to be supported with further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS The aim of this study was to investigate the oxidative damage and inflammatory effects in the hippocampus and cerebellum in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis model and possible ameliorating effects of pregabalin (PG). METHODS: Twenty four female Wistar Albino rats (12 month old) were divided into 3 groups as follows: Group I (Control; 0.1 ml/gavage and i.p. saline, single dose), Group II (LPS; 5 mg/kg LPS, i.p, single dose), Group III (LPS + PG; 5 mg/kg LPS, i.p, single dose + 30 mg/kg, gavage, single dose). DNA damage, ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) oxidative stress index (OSI), leukocyte (WBC), lymphocyte, neutrophil, hemoglobin (HGB), erythrocyte (RBC), and thrombocyte counts were measured in blood and brain tissues. Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation of Caspase- 3, G-CSF, IL-6, SAA, iNOS expressions were conducted using hippocampus and cerebellum tissues. RESULTS: Comet analysis score, lymphocytes, neutrophils, WBC, IMA, TOS and OSI values were increased in Group II compared with to Group I (p < 0.05). IMA levels in blood, TOS and OSI levels in the brain were significantly decreased in Group III compared to Group II (p < 0.05). We observed increased hemorrhages, neutrophils, leukocytes infiltrations and neuron degeneration in Group II compared to Group I. Caspase 3, G-CSF, IL-6, SAA, iNOS expressions were increased in group II compared to Group I (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pregabalin partly ameliorated the damage caused by the exposure to LPS in hippocampus and cerebellum; however, further studies are needed to determine pregabalin's possible protective effects at different doses and with different techniques.

AB  - OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of rectosigmoid resection (RR) and Douglas peritonectomy (DP) on postoperative complications and survival in advanced-stage ovarian cancer surgery. METHODS/MATERIALS: Patients who underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery including RR and DP between January 2007 and January 2013 were included. Patients with deeper invasion into the muscularis and mucosal layer reported in pathology results and colon wall injury necessitating suturing or resection suggesting invasion of implants into the colon wall were excluded. The decision for RR or DP was made according to the surgical team and patients' preference. Resections were performed with the suspicion of colon wall invasion. The collected data were age, previous operations, preoperative cancer antigen 125 and albumin levels, surgical procedures, duration of surgery, tumor histology, recurrence, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and length of hospital stay. Kaplan-Meir survival estimates were calculated and compared between the groups using the log-rank test. Cox proportional models were built to evaluate factors that affected disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Age, body mass index, preoperative cancer antigen 125 levels, albumin levels, and amount of ascites were similar between the groups. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery was performed in 15% of both groups. End colostomy was performed in 23.7% of the RR group, and only 5.08% of the patients underwent diverting ileostomy procedures. There was no significant difference in terms of surgical complications between the groups. Recurrence occurred in the RR and DP groups at rates of 42% and 47%, respectively. Only primary debulking surgery had an effect on overall survival (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.88). Overall survival and disease-free survival were similar in the RR and DP groups. CONCLUSIONS: Douglas peritonectomy showed similar survival and surgical outcomes to RR and provided shorter hospital stay and earlier admission to chemotherapy in the management of serosal implants during advanced-stage ovarian cancer surgery.

AB  - The aim of this study is to present our clinical experience about fertility-sparing procedures in early stage cervical cancer and its obstetrical and oncological outcomes. Between the years 2006 and 2016, a total of 22 early stage cervical cancer patients who underwent a fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy in our clinic were retrospectively analysed. The median age was 33 (range: 28-39) years. The median follow-up was 47 (range: 22-125) months. Five patients (22.7%) had Stage IA1, three patients had (13.6%) Stage IA2, and 14 patients (63.6%) had Stage IB1 disease. Only one patient had a recurrence. A pregnancy was obtained in five patients (22.7%) and one of them (20%) had a live birth. A pregnancy was obtained spontaneously in two patients (40%), whereas assisted reproductive techniques were used in three of the patients (60%). A miscarriage occurred in two patients (40%), and one of them was within the first trimester and the other was within the second trimester. Impact statement What is already known on the subject? Currently, the first-line treatment of early stage cervical cancer is surgery. However, a fertility-sparing trachelectomy is the most widely adopted approach in the reproductive aged patients who have a desire to be pregnant later. What does this study add? In the literature, there is a growing number of studies on this subject. However, it would take time to obtain adequate knowledge. We believe that our study would contribute to the existing data. What are the implication of these findings for clinical practice? This study is important as it indicates that a multidisciplinary approach is required to preserve fertility among gynaecologic oncologists and the outcomes would be reflected into the clinical practice. In addition, we believe that our study would pave the way for further studies regarding this subject among oncologists.

AB  - Random skin flaps are essential tools in reconstructive surgery. In this study, we investigated the effect of subdermal nitrous oxide (N2O) application on random flap survival. In this experimental study, we used 21 female rats in three groups. In the N2O and air groups, gases were administrated under the proposed dorsal flap areas daily for seven days. Following the treatment period, flaps were raised and inserted back into their place from the dorsal skin. In the control group, the flaps were elevated and inserted back to their place without any pretreatment. Calculation of necrotic flap areas, histological examination and microangiography was performed to evaluate the results 7 days after the flap surgery. The average of necrotic flap area in the N2O, air and control group was 13.45%, 37.67% and 46.43%, respectively. (N2O vs air p = .044; N2O vs control p = .003). The average number of capillary formations identified in the histological analysis was 7.0 +/- 1.58, 3.75 +/- 2.36 and 4.4 +/- 0.54 in the N2O, air and control group, respectively. (N2O vs air p = .017; N2O vs control p = .037). The average number of capillary structures identified in the angiography images were 6.3 +/- 1.52, 1.6 +/- 1.15 and 1.3 +/- 0.57 in the N2O, air and control group, respectively. (N2O vs air p = .04; N2O vs control p = .02). We conclude that subdermal N2O application increases random flap survival through an increase in the skin microcirculation and could be promising for future clinical applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND Recently a new system for reporting salivary gland fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology was proposed, the Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC). Herein, we evaluated diagnostic accuracy of salivary gland FNA, comparing the system previously used in our hospital with the Milan system. METHODS: Salivary gland specimens obtained between 2011 and 2017 were reclassified according to MSRSGC. Risk of malignancy for each diagnostic category was determined. Diagnostic yield of both classifications was evaluated. RESULTS: The cases (n = 388) were classified according to the old system: nondiagnostic (n = 28), benign (n = 246), atypical (n = 36), neoplastic (n = 57), suspicious for malignancy (n = 7) and malignant (n = 14). The lesions were distributed according to the MSRSGC: nondiagnostic (n = 28), non-neoplastic (n = 89), atypia of undetermined significance (n = 39), benign neoplasm (n = 156), neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential (n = 55), suspicious for malignancy (n = 7) and malignant (n = 14). When considering only benign and malignant cases, both classifications showed the same sensitivity (62.5%), specificity (100%) and similar accuracy (95.8%). Comparison between the two systems showed no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Salivary gland FNA has high diagnostic accuracy and assists clinical management independently of the reporting system used, however, in some cases, the use of Milan system could be beneficial, since it allows an enhanced category stratification.

AB  - The 1,2,4-triazole and its derivatives were reported to exhibit various pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antitumoural, cytotoxic, and antioxidant properties. In this study, a series of triazole compounds (M1-M10) were evaluated for some biological activities. In vitro qualifications of these compounds on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and human carbonic anhydrase enzyme activities were performed. Also, their antitumoral activities in human colon cancer (HT29) cell line cultures were examined. In addition, colon cancer experimentation was induced in rats by an in vivo method, and the in vivo anticancer effects of triazole derivatives were investigated. Also, the effects of these derivatives in levels of antioxidant vitamin A, vitamin E, and MDA were studied in rat liver and blood samples. Most of the compounds were found to exhibit significant antioxidant and antitumoral activities. All the compounds had cytotoxic activities on HT29 cell lines with their IC50 values lower than 10 microM concentrations. The low IC 50 values of the compounds are M1 (3.88 microM), M2 (2.18 microM), M3 (4.2 microM), M4 (2.58 microM), M5 (2.88 microM), M6 (2.37 microM), M7 (3.49 microM), M8 (4.01 microM), M9 (8.90 microM), and M10 (3.12 microM).

AB  - Tumor deposits (TD) are irregular discrete tumor masses in adipose tissue, discontinuous from the primary tumor, that are described in various cancers. The incidence and/or prognostic value of TD in breast carcinomas have not been studied so far. We reevaluated 145 breast cancer patients, diagnosed and treated between 2001 and 2006 at our institution for the presence and incidence of TD. Histologic type, grade, size of the primary tumor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status of the tumor, and presence of peritumoral lymphovascular invasion were included in the data. TD were detected in 42 cases (29.0%). The mean age of the patients was 52.2 years (27-82). Most patients (79.3%) had either invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) or invasive lobular carcinoma, and most tumors (86.9%) were either grade 2 or 3. After excluding TD from the number of metastatic lymph nodes, the pN status of 9 patients changed. Univariate analysis of 110 patients with follow-up information revealed that the new pN status (p = 0.036), presence of local recurrence (p = 0.016) and TD (p = 0.003) were significantly correlated with distant metastases. The median follow-up of the patients was 84 months (5-161), 10-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 67.2% and 73.7%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, presence of TD remained independently associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.002). The probability of distant metastasis was 3.3 times higher in patients with TD. These results emphasize that TD are present in breast cancer patients, and that their presence should warn the clinician in terms of possible distant metastasis. Therefore, presence of TD, the evaluation of which is neither time consuming nor require sophisticated methods, should be included in pathology reports.

AB  - Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) are classified according to tumor grade. Ki-67 and mitotic count are the two determinants of this classification. Therefore, Ki-67 scoring becomes very important in classifying the patients accurately. Eye-balling, counting of cells through the microscope, automated image analysis systems, and manual counting of printed image are the four major scoring methods in use. The aim of this study is to show the agreement between monitor-image method (MIM) and printout-image method (PIM) of Ki-67 scoring. In our study, 120 GEP-NETs from 85 patients diagnosed between January 2005 and July 2017 were evaluated. Thirty-seven cases with either polypectomy or resection material were selected. Seven different scoring methods using either a monitor-image or a printout-image were applied for Ki-67 scoring. They are as follows: whole-PIM, 1/9-PIM, whole-MIM, 1/4-MIM, 1/6-MIM, 1/9-MIM, and 1/12-MIM. In the comparison of Ki-67 scoring methods, intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.951 to 0.999 were found. The Bland-Altman analysis showed near-perfect agreement between whole-MIM and whole-PIM as well as 1/9-MIM and 1/9-PIM. The level of agreements among the other methods were sufficient too, but there was a relative decrease in the level of agreement as the area of counting becomes smaller. The average application time decreased from 373.7 to 41.7 s gradually as the scoring area becomes smaller. Our study shows that there is a remarkable agreement between the MIM and PIM used in Ki-67 scoring.

AB  - AIM Ethambutol and isoniazid are two major effective first line agents in tuberculosis treatment having some visual adverse effects. We aimed to determine the protective effects of lutein on oxidative optic neuropathy induced by ethambutol and isoniazid in an experimental model. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Totally 24 albino Wistar male rats were assigned into 4 groups, with 6 rats in each group as follows: healthy controls (HC group), 50 mg/kg ethambutol +50 mg/kg isoniazid administered group (EI), 0.5 mg/kg lutein +50 mg/kg ethambutol +50 mg/kg isoniazid administered group (LEI-05) and only Lutein (0.5 mg/kg) (LUT group) administered group. From the blood samples and tissues obtained from the rats, Malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (GSH), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were studied. Histopathological evaluations were performed at the end of the study. RESULTS: Serum and tissue IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and MDA levels were the highest in EI group which were significantly lower in lutein administered group. On the other hand, serum and tissue total GSH levels were the lowest in EI group which were significantly higher in Lutein administered group. In histopathological evaluations, there were significant differences between EI group and all other three groups with edema and hemorrhage in connective tissue covering optic nerve, dilated and congested capillary, decrease in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSION: Isoniazid and ethambutol induced toxic optic neuropathy although not common, may have some potential devastating effects on vision. Lutein is determined as an effective agent in prevention of isoniazid and ethambutol induced toxic optic neuropathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND Recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) has demonstrated efficacy for on-demand treatment of bleeding in severe von Willebrand disease (VWD), warranting evaluation in the surgical setting. OBJECTIVES: This study (NCT02283268) evaluated the hemostatic efficacy/safety profile of rVWF, with/without recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII), in patients with severe VWD undergoing surgery. PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients received rVWF 40-60 IU/kg, VWF ristocetin cofactor activity was measured 12-24 hours before surgery. If endogenous FVIII activity (FVIII:C) target levels were achieved 3 hours before surgery, rVWF was administered alone 1 hour before surgery; rVWF was coadministered with rFVIII if target endogenous FVIII levels were not achieved. rVWF was infused postoperatively to maintain target trough levels. Overall and intraoperative hemostatic efficacy, the pharmacodynamics of rVWF administration and the incidence of adverse events (AEs) were assessed. RESULTS: All patients treated with rVWF for major (n=10), minor (n=4), and oral (n=1) surgery had overall and intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings of excellent (73.3% and 86.7%) or good (26.7% and 13.3%). Most rVWF infusions (89.4%) were administered alone, resulting in hemostatically effective levels of endogenous FVIII within 6 hours, that were sustained for 72-96 hours; 70% (n=7/10) of major surgeries were performed without rFVIII coadministration. Six patients reported 12 treatment-emergent AEs. Two patients each had 1 serious AE: diverticulitis (not treatment related) and deep vein thrombosis (sponsor assessed as possibly treatment-related). No severe allergic reactions or inhibitory antibodies were reported. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the efficacy and safety profile of rVWF in patients with severe VWD undergoing elective surgery.

AB  - To evaluate the association between type of invaded vessels (blood or lymphatic) and cervical involvement in endometrial cancer (EC). Pathological slides of 93 patients with EC who had vascular space invasion in hematoxylin-eosin staining underwent immunohistochemical assay with CD31 and podoplanin. CD31 and podoplanin were used to identify blood and lymphatic invaded vessels, respectively. Cervical stromal invasion (CSI) was determined in 21 (30%) patients. The rate of CD31-positivity was significantly higher in patients with CSI than without (76.2 and 34.7%, p = 0.001; respectively). Podoplanin-positivity was determined in 47.6 and 81.6% of patients with and without CSI, respectively (p = 0.005). Age, myometrial invasion and the combination of CD31-positivity with podoplanin-negativity were found as independent predictors for CSI. Blood vessel invasion is an important factor for CSI in EC. Blood vessel invasion rather than lymphatic vessel invasion is one of the predominant ways by which EC spreads to the cervix.

AB  - Metastatic involvement of the ovaries is not rare. The most common tumor types metastasizing to the ovaries, from non-gynecological organs, are breast, colorectal, gastric, and appendix tumors. Lymphogenous, hematogenous, and transcoelomic pathways have all been proposed among potential pathways. Early diagnosis and treatment have an important potential to improve the patient outcome. Krukenberg tumors typically appear as complex semisolid masses with varying amounts of solid and cystic components. Ovarian metastases from the colon primaries are predominantly cystic in nature. Secondary lymphomatous involvement of ovary is mostly bilateral and solid with heterogeneous signal intensity on MRI. Metastatic breast cancer to the ovaries is typically bilateral and tends to be of small size. Among all the other imaging characteristics, bilateral involvement of secondary tumors of the ovary appears to be most potentially helpful finding in differentiating from primary ones.

AB  - In Reinke's space of human vocal fold, type III collagen forms a three dimensional network and this contains numerous minute chambers in between these fibers. These compartments are occupied by glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins. In laryngeal fold lesions, such as Reinke's edema and vocal fold polyps, proteoglycan (PG)/hyaluronic acid (HA) components of extracellular matrix increased. We investigated the size and quantity of the minute chambers within Reinke's space, filled with PG/HA with the aid of transmission electron microscopy. Eight vocal fold polyps and 10 mucosal biopsies (as control group) were all evaluated by light microscopy and electron microscopy. We detected that PG/HA in extracellular matrix had been increased in vocal fold lesions when compared with control group, by Alcian Blue-pH 2.5 stain. The mean volume of the chambers in Reinke's space of normal larynx was measured as 0.040233 microm(2) whereas the mean volume of these chambers in vocal fold polyps was measured as 6.420221 microm(2). The difference between the volumes of these chambers in vocal fold polyps and in control group was statistically significant (P=0.001). Within these chambers PG/HA were found and PG/HA filling these chambers were increased in vocal fold polyps. We think proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycans, especially HA, play an important role in determining biochemical properties of vocal fold lesions.

AB  - GOAL We evaluated the potential for prenatal diagnosis of merosin-negative muscular dystrophies by immunohistochemistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 12 pregnancies with merosin-negative muscular dystrophy in a prior child. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) was performed between 11th to 13th gestational weeks. Merosin immunohistochemical studies were performed on trophoblastic cells. RESULTS: Two of 12 were "merosin-negative," both were from the same family. Fetal ultrasonographies were evaluated as normal in these pregnancies. Eight of the 10 merosin-positive cases delivered healthy babies. Two were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Prenatal diagnosis of merosin-negative muscular dystrophies can be accomplished by immunohistochemical analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE Upregulation of N-cadherin in epithelial tumor cells has been reported to enhance the invasive process. Although the distribution of N-cadherin in the normal testis was demonstrated, there is no adequate information regarding its presence in testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs). Our purpose was to examine the expression and localization of N-cadherin in germ cell tumors of the testis and share our experience. METHODS: 104 adult cases of primary and metastatic testicular GCTs, 5 germ cell neoplasia in situ and 15 benign testicular tissues were included into the study and analyzed for immunoexpression of N-cadherin. Positive expression was evaluated according to intensity and localization of the staining. RESULTS: In 34 pure seminomas, 6 seminomas of mixed component and 16 metastatic seminomas, N-cadherin expression was observed with variable staining intensity. Two pure yolk sac tumors and 20 out of 34 mixed GCTs with yolk sac components were positive for N-cadherin. In contrast, neither the embryonal and chorionic carcinomas nor the teratomas showed N-cadherin expression. CONCLUSIONS: N-cadherin immunexpression should be interpreted considering both staining intensity and extent. In case of a metastatic tumor of unknown primary showing prominent N-cadherin expression, seminoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis. At the same time Ncadherin staining could be used to differentiate seminomas from embryonal carcinomas with solid components in metastatic GCTs, both having similar histopathological findings. On the other hand, the diagnostic value is not obvious for nonseminomatous tumors.

AB  - The response to respiratory viruses varies substantially between individuals, and there are currently no known molecular predictors from the early stages of infection. Here we conduct a community-based analysis to determine whether pre- or early post-exposure molecular factors could predict physiologic responses to viral exposure. Using peripheral blood gene expression profiles collected from healthy subjects prior to exposure to one of four respiratory viruses (H1N1, H3N2, Rhinovirus, and RSV), as well as up to 24 h following exposure, we find that it is possible to construct models predictive of symptomatic response using profiles even prior to viral exposure. Analysis of predictive gene features reveal little overlap among models; however, in aggregate, these genes are enriched for common pathways. Heme metabolism, the most significantly enriched pathway, is associated with a higher risk of developing symptoms following viral exposure. This study demonstrates that pre-exposure molecular predictors can be identified and improves our understanding of the mechanisms of response to respiratory viruses.

AB  - Chordomas are rare malignant tumors that develop from the residual of embryonic notochord. These tumors may be seen along the spine and have a local aggressive progression. Skull base chordomas often originate from the clivus as localization. These tumors are usually found to be overgrown when they are diagnosed. They are locally invasive and rarely develop distant metastasis. These chordomas cannot usually be completely removed due to their localization. Because these tumors are advanced at the time of diagnosis and are adjacent to important structures, they are among the tumors with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Surgery and/or radiotherapy is administered for the treatment.

AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction condition response resulting in acute lung injury. Urotensin II (UII), an endogenous vasoactive peptide, is widely distributed in pulmonary, cardiovascular, central nervous, renal and metabolic systems, and especially in inflammatory regions. This study aimed to investigate whether urotensin II (UII) and UII receptor (UTR) antagonists play a role in the inflammatory response to sepsis-induced lung damage and they are possible therapeutic targets. In the study, 78 male Balb-c mice were used. A cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced polymicrobial sepsis model was applied, and the effects of human urotensin II (agonist) and urantide and palosuran (antagonists) were investigated on lung tissues. Glutathione and malondialdehyde levels and SOD activity of lung tissues were investigated in addition to TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, NF-kappaB, and UTR mRNA levels. Also, lung sections were histopathologically evaluated. Urantide and palosuran, UII receptor antagonists, decreased proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, NF-kappaB, and also decreased oxidative stress parameters in lung tissue, which are markers of damage. UTR mRNA expression was increased in septic lungs, and both antagonists significantly decreased the elevated receptor level. Also, histopathological examination showed beneficial effects of both agonists on lung tissue. The results of this study help to understand the inflammatory and therapeutic contribution of the UII/UTR system on sepsis-induced lung damage. We can suggest that UTR receptor antagonists may be evaluated as a potential drug which reduces sepsis-induced lung damage in the future.

AB  - De novo variants in DDX3X account for 1-3% of unexplained intellectual disability (ID) cases and are amongst the most common causes of ID especially in females. Forty-seven patients (44 females, 3 males) have been described. We identified 31 additional individuals carrying 29 unique DDX3X variants, including 30 postnatal individuals with complex clinical presentations of developmental delay or ID, and one fetus with abnormal ultrasound findings. Rare or novel phenotypes observed include respiratory problems, congenital heart disease, skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA depletion, and late-onset neurologic decline. Our findings expand the spectrum of DNA variants and phenotypes associated with DDX3X disorders.

AB  - PURPOSE Pathogenic variants in ARID1B are one of the most frequent causes of intellectual disability (ID) as determined by large-scale exome sequencing studies. Most studies published thus far describe clinically diagnosed Coffin-Siris patients (ARID1B-CSS) and it is unclear whether these data are representative for patients identified through sequencing of unbiased ID cohorts (ARID1B-ID). We therefore sought to determine genotypic and phenotypic differences between ARID1B-ID and ARID1B-CSS. In parallel, we investigated the effect of different methods of phenotype reporting. METHODS: Clinicians entered clinical data in an extensive web-based survey. RESULTS: 79 ARID1B-CSS and 64 ARID1B-ID patients were included. CSS-associated dysmorphic features, such as thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, thick alae nasi, long and/or broad philtrum, small nails and small or absent fifth distal phalanx and hypertrichosis, were observed significantly more often (p < 0.001) in ARID1B-CSS patients. No other significant differences were identified. CONCLUSION: There are only minor differences between ARID1B-ID and ARID1B-CSS patients. ARID1B-related disorders seem to consist of a spectrum, and patients should be managed similarly. We demonstrated that data collection methods without an explicit option to report the absence of a feature (such as most Human Phenotype Ontology-based methods) tended to underestimate gene-related features.

AB  - Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW; Triticum durum L. x Aegilops tauschii Coss.) is a means of introducing novel genes/genomic regions into bread wheat (T. aestivum L.) and a potential genetic resource for improving grain mineral concentrations. We quantified 10 grain minerals (Ca, Cd, Cu, Co, Fe, Li, Mg, Mn, Ni, and Zn) using an inductively coupled mass spectrometer in 123 SHWs for a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A GWAS with 35,648 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers identified 92 marker-trait associations (MTAs), of which 60 were novel and 40 were within genes, and the genes underlying 20 MTAs had annotations suggesting a potential role in grain mineral concentration. Twenty-four MTAs on the D-genome were novel and showed the potential of Ae. tauschii for improving grain mineral concentrations such as Ca, Co, Cu, Li, Mg, Mn, and Ni. Interestingly, the large number of novel MTAs (36) identified on the AB genome of these SHWs indicated that there is a lot of variation yet to be explored and to be used in the A and B genome along with the D-genome. Regression analysis identified a positive correlation between a cumulative number of favorable alleles at MTA loci in a genotype and grain mineral concentration. Additionally, we identified multi-traits and stable MTAs and recommended 13 top 10% SHWs with a higher concentration of beneficial grain minerals (Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, and Zn), a large number of favorable alleles compared to low ranking genotypes and checks that could be utilized in the breeding program for the genetic biofortification. This study will further enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of grain minerals in wheat and related cereals.

AB  - Detecting morphological changes of dendritic spines in time-lapse microscopy images and correlating them with functional properties such as memory and learning, are fundamental and challenging problems in neurobiology research. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dendritic spine detection in time series. The proposed approach initially performs spine detection at each time point and improves the accuracy by exploiting the information obtained from tracking of individual spines over time. To detect dendritic spines in a time point image we employ an SVM classifier trained by pre-labeled SIFT feature descriptors in combination with a dot enhancement filter. Second, to track the growth or loss of spines, we apply a SIFT-based rigid registration method for the alignment of time-series images. This step takes into account both the structure and the movement of objects, combined with a robust dynamic scheme to link information about spines that disappear and reappear over time. Next, we improve spine detection by employing a probabilistic dynamic programming approach to search for an optimum solution to accurately detect missed spines. Finally, we determine the spine location more precisely by performing a watershed-geodesic active contour model. We quantitatively assess the performance of the proposed spine detection algorithm based on annotations performed by biologists and compare its performance with the results obtained by the noncommercial software NeuronIQ. Experiments show that our approach can accurately detect and quantify spines in 2-photon microscopy time-lapse data and is able to accurately identify spine elimination and formation.

AB  - BACKGROUND Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men who are especially over the age of 50 years in the western countries. Currently used therapeutic modalities mostly fail to give positive clinical outcomes and nearly 30% of the PCa patients eventually develop clinical recurrence. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of PCa progression is of paramount importance to help determining the course of disease. In this study, we aimed at profiling the differentially expressed microRNAs in recurrent PCa samples. METHODS: We profiled the microRNA expression of 20 recurrent and 20 non-recurrent PCa patients with microRNA microarray, and validated the differential expression of significantly deregulated microRNAs in 40 recurrent and 39 non-recurrent PCa specimens using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Data were statistically analyzed using two-sided Student's t-test, Pearson Correlation test, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that a total of 682 probes were significantly deregulated in recurrent versus non-recurrent PCa specimen comparison. Among those, we confirmed the significant downregulation of miR-424 and upregulation of miR-572 with further qRT-PCR analysis in a larger sample set. Further ROC analysis showed that these microRNAs have enough power to distinguish recurrent specimens from non-recurrent ones on their own. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report that differential expression of miR-424 and miR-572 in recurrent PCa specimens can serve as novel biomarkers for prediction of PCa progression.

AB  - Purpose Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an auto inflammatory disease characterized by periodic fever, synovitis and serositis. Patients may be admitted to gastroenterology units due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In this study; we aimed to analyze endoscopic findings and diagnostic utility of endoscopic procedure in children with FMF. Methods: Patient with FMF that was performed endoscopy for the gastrointestinal symptoms were included to the study (39 of 164 patients, 53 procedure). A control group was randomly designed as age and gender matched four endoscopic procedures per one endoscopic procedure of patients with FMF (n=212). Results: No different was found between the patients and control group in esophagogastroscopy findings. However, the diagnosis of gastrointestinal pathology was made by esophagogastroscopy in 46.2% patients. Colonoscopic examination revealed that the frequency of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was higher in undiagnosed patients compared to both the control group (50.0% vs. 6.9%, p<0.05, odds ratio [OR]:13.4 and 95% confidence inteval [95% CI]: 2.1-84.3) and the patients under colchicine treatment (50.0% vs. 8.3%, p<0.05, OR: 11 and 95% CI: 0.8-147.8). Colonoscopic procedure that was made after the diagnosis was found to provide contribution by 16.7% in determining the etiology of the additional symptoms. Conclusion: Patients with FMF may be admitted to pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinic prior to diagnosis or during the follow-up period. The frequency of IBD is high in undiagnosed patients with FMF. Endoscopic procedures may be helpful in these patients for the diagnosis accompanying mucosal lesions.

AB  - Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare and progressive disease caused by uncontrolled alternative complement activation. Dysregulation of the complement activation results in thrombotic microangiopathy and multiorgan damage. A 29-yearold woman who was admitted with complaints of vomiting and headache was detected to have acute renal failure with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). After the diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), she was treated with plasma exchange (PE) and hemodialysis (HD). She has experienced hypertensionrelated posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) at the second plasma exchange. She was initiated on eculizumab therapy because of no response to PE on the 34(th) days. Her renal functions progressively improved with eculizumab treatment. Dependence on dialysis was over by the 4(th) month. Dialysis free-serum Creatinine level was 2.2 mg/dL [glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR): 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)] after 24 months. Neurological involvement (PRES, etc.) is the most common extrarenal complication and a major cause of mortality and morbidity from aHUS. More importantly, we showed that renal recovery may be obtained following late-onset eculizumab treatment in patient with aHUS after a long dependence on hemodialysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND Tobacco smoking is a risk factor for multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Many smoking-associated signals have been detected in the blood methylome, but the extent to which these changes are widespread to metabolically relevant tissues, and impact gene expression or metabolic health, remains unclear. METHODS: We investigated smoking-associated DNA methylation and gene expression variation in adipose tissue biopsies from 542 healthy female twins. Replication, tissue specificity, and longitudinal stability of the smoking-associated effects were explored in additional adipose, blood, skin, and lung samples. We characterized the impact of adipose tissue smoking methylation and expression signals on metabolic disease risk phenotypes, including visceral fat. RESULTS: We identified 42 smoking-methylation and 42 smoking-expression signals, where five genes (AHRR, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYTL1, F2RL3) were both hypo-methylated and upregulated in current smokers. CYP1A1 gene expression achieved 95% prediction performance of current smoking status. We validated and replicated a proportion of the signals in additional primary tissue samples, identifying tissue-shared effects. Smoking leaves systemic imprints on DNA methylation after smoking cessation, with stronger but shorter-lived effects on gene expression. Metabolic disease risk traits such as visceral fat and android-to-gynoid ratio showed association with methylation at smoking markers with functional impacts on expression, such as CYP1A1, and at tissue-shared smoking signals, such as NOTCH1. At smoking-signals, BHLHE40 and AHRR DNA methylation and gene expression levels in current smokers were predictive of future gain in visceral fat upon smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first comprehensive characterization of coordinated DNA methylation and gene expression markers of smoking in adipose tissue. The findings relate to human metabolic health and give insights into understanding the widespread health consequence of smoking outside of the lung.

AB  - BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the HPV positivity rate in patients with laryngeal cancer, and to determine the effect of HPV positivity on survival. An additional aim was to determine if patients with HPV positive laryngeal cancer are more sensitive to chemotherapy and if such sensitivity differs according to chemotherapy protocol. METHODS: The study included laryngeal specimens obtained from 82 laryngeal cancer patients and 11 laryngeal specimens with normal laryngeal mucosa that were obtained from our hospital's paraffin block archives between 1995 and 2013. HPV was detected via chromogenic in situ hybridization (cISH) and confirmed via genotyping. RESULTS: HPV was not detected in any of the 82 laryngeal cancer patients' laryngeal specimens, nor in any of the 11 archived laryngeal specimens with normal laryngeal mucosa via cISH. Genotyping confirmed these findings; none of the HPV types studied were detected in any of the specimens. As none of the study samples were HPV positive, it was not possible to compare survival, recurrence, or chemotherapy sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: HPV infection is not a leading cause of laryngeal cancer; however, additional research on HPV positivity in patients with laryngeal cancer and its effect on recurrence, survival, and chemotherapy sensitivity is warranted.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Coley, in 1892, reported 14 cases of a hydrocele in women. He described this "affection" as being "too rare an anomaly to deserve consideration. The rarity of this finding continues to be described in more current literature of 400 cases. CASE PRESENTATION: 42-year-old woman presented to the clinic with a palpable mass in her left inguinal region. On physical examination, a soft-consistency, mobile mass of about 4 cm in size was seen in the left inguinal region. The cystic lesion which was seen to be originated from the inguinal canal was excised in the exploration made by suspending the round ligament by passing through the anatomical folds with the incision made from the left inguinal region. The defect was repaired with prolene mesh after high ligation. Patient was discharged on the 1st postoperative day. DISCUSSION: In women, a round ligament is attached to the uterus close to the origin of the fallopian tubes, and the extension of the parietal peritoneum follows the round ligament as it passes to the inguinal canal through the internal ring. Hydroceles of the canal of Nuck were not conclusively diagnosed until surgery was performed on a suspected inguinal hernia. The treatment of Nuck canale hydroceles are surgery. Ligating the prosessus vaginalis and excision of the cyst in surgical treatment will prevent recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Nuck canal cysts should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases of female patient's complaints of swelling in the inguinal region.

AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization is a precursor to pneumococcal disease. Although children with a tracheostomy have an increased risk of pneumococcal pneumonia, the pneumococci colonizing their lower airways remain largely uncharacterized. We sought to compare lower respiratory tract isolates colonizing tracheostomy patients and a convenience sample of isolates from individuals intubated for acute conditions. We collected pneumococcal isolates from the lower respiratory tract of 27 patients with a tracheostomy and 42 patients intubated for acute conditions. We compared the penicillin susceptibility, rates of co-colonization, genetic background, and serotype of isolates colonizing these patient populations. Isolates from both groups showed high genetic diversity. Forty multi-locus sequence types and 20 serotypes were identified. There was no significant difference in serotype distribution, co-colonization rates, vaccine coverage, or non-susceptibility to penicillin among pneumococcal isolates from the two groups. Colonization of the lower airways with non-vaccine serotypes 15B/C, 23B and 35B was noted for the first time in patients with tracheostomies and supports recently observed increases in nasopharyngeal colonization and disease due to these serotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND COQ2 mutations cause a rare infantile multisystemic disease with heterogeneous clinical features. Promising results have been reported in response to Coenzyme Q10 treatment, especially for kidney involvement, but little is known about the long-term outcomes. METHODS: We report four new patients from two families with the c.437G-->A (p.Ser146Asn) mutation in COQ2 and the outcomes of two patients after long-term coenzyme Q10 treatment. RESULTS: Index cases from two families presented with vomiting, nephrotic range proteinuria, and diabetes in early infancy. These patients were diagnosed with coenzyme Q10 deficiency and died shortly after diagnosis. Siblings of the index cases later presented with neonatal diabetes and proteinuria and were diagnosed at the first day of life. Coenzyme Q10 treatment was started immediately. The siblings responded dramatically to coenzyme Q10 treatment with normalized glucose and proteinuria levels, but they developed refractory focal clonic seizures beginning at three months of life that progressed to encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort with CoQ10 deficiency, neurological involvement did not improve with oral coenzyme Q10 treatment despite the initial recovery from the diabetes and nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND Complete and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS, PAIS) are associated with an increased risk of gonadal germ cell cancer (GGCC). Recent guidelines recommend gonadectomy in women with CAIS in late adolescence. Nevertheless, many adult women prefer to retain their gonads. AIMS: This study aims to explore attitudes towards gonadectomy in AIS in centres around the world, estimate the proportion of adults with retained gonads and/or who developed GGCC, and explore reasons for declining gonadectomy. METHODS: A survey was performed among health care professionals who use the International DSD Registry (I-DSD). RESULTS: Data were provided from 22 centres in 16 countries on 166 women (CAIS) and 26 men (PAIS). In CAIS, gonadectomy was recommended in early adulthood in 67% of centres; 19/166 (11.4%) women refused gonadectomy. Among 142 women who had gonadectomy, evidence of germ cell neoplasm in situ (GCNIS), the precursor of GGCC, was reported in 2 (1.4%) out of 8 from whom pathology results were formally provided. Nine out of 26 men with PAIS (34.6%) had retained gonads; 11% of centres recommended routine gonadectomy in PAIS. CONCLUSION: Although development of GGCC seems rare, gonadectomy after puberty is broadly recommended in CAIS; in PAIS this is more variable. Overall, our data reflect the need for evidence-based guidelines regarding prophylactic gonadectomy in AIS.

AB  - Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease with mononuclear cell infiltration and destruction of the lacrimal gland and salivary glands, which cause dryness of the eyes and mouth. The most common neurological condition seen in SS is peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestation of SS as an acute fulminant peripheral neuropathy is extremely rare. We report a 42-year-old patient presenting with acute motor sensory-axonal neuropathy in the presence of SS. She showed partial response to intravenous immunoglobulin but favourable clinical improvement was seen after initiation of corticosteroid treatment.

AB  - Delayed 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been associated with improved diagnostic yield in several malignancies; however, data on the use of delayed imaging in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is scarce. This study aimed to examine tumoral and background standardized uptake value (SUV) alterations in dual-phase F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging.Fifty-two HCC cases underwent dual-time-point F-FDG PET/CT examination where early and delayed images were obtained. The maximum and mean SUVs (SUVmax and SUVmean) of the tumor were determined for both time points. Similarly, the average SUVmean were also determined for background (liver, soft tissue, and spleen). Changes in tumoral and background SUV between early and delayed images were examined.The mean age was 62.0 +/- 12.9 years (range, 20-88 years) and the majority of the patients were men (86.5%). Tumor SUVs, both tumor SUVmean and tumor SUVmax, significantly increased at delayed images when compared to early images. In contrast, the average SUVmean for the liver, soft tissue, and spleen significantly decreased at delayed images.A significant increase in tumor SUV in delayed images in contrast to a significant decrease in background SUVs suggests that delayed images in HCC may contribute to diagnostic performance through a potential increase in the contrast between the tumor and background. However, further studies with larger sample sizes including patients with benign lesions and different grades of the disease are warranted to better elucidate the diagnostic contribution as well as the association of delayed imaging values with prognosis.

AB  - The most commonly used radiological method for age estimation of living individuals is X-ray. Computed tomography is not commonly used due to high radiation exposure, which raises ethical concerns. This problem can be solved with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which avoids the use of ionizing radiation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the utility of MRI analysis of the proximal humeral epiphyses for forensic age estimations of living individuals. In this study, 395 left proximal humeral epiphyses (patient age 12-30 years) were evaluated with fast-spin-echo proton density-weighted image (FSE PD) sequences in a coronal oblique orientation on shoulder MRI images. A five-stage scoring system was used following the method of Dedouit et al. The intra- and interobserver reliabilities assessed using Cohen's kappa statistic were kappa = 0.818 and kappa = 0.798, respectively. According to this study, stage five first appeared at 20 and 21 years of age in males and females, respectively. These results are not directly comparable to any other published study due to the lack of MRI data on proximal humeral head development. These findings may provide valuable information for legally important age thresholds using shoulder MRI. The current study demonstrates that MRI of the proximal humerus can support forensic age estimation. Further research is needed to establish a standardized protocol that can be applied worldwide.

AB  - For prostate cancer detection on prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems aim to widely improve standardization across radiologists and centers. Our goal was to evaluate CAD assistance in prostate cancer detection compared with conventional mpMRI interpretation in a diverse dataset acquired from five institutions tested by nine readers of varying experience levels, in total representing 14 globally spread institutions. Index lesion sensitivities of mpMRI-alone were 79% (whole prostate (WP)), 84% (peripheral zone (PZ)), 71% (transition zone (TZ)), similar to CAD at 76% (WP, p=0.39), 77% (PZ, p=0.07), 79% (TZ, p=0.15). Greatest CAD benefit was in TZ for moderately-experienced readers at PI-RADSv2 <3 (84% vs mpMRI-alone 67%, p=0.055). Detection agreement was unchanged but CAD-assisted read times improved (4.6 vs 3.4 minutes, p<0.001). At PI-RADSv2 >/= 3, CAD improved patient-level specificity (72%) compared to mpMRI-alone (45%, p<0.001). PI-RADSv2 and CAD-assisted mpMRI interpretations have similar sensitivities across multiple sites and readers while CAD has potential to improve specificity and moderately-experienced radiologists' detection of more difficult tumors in the center of the gland. The multi-institutional evidence provided is essential to future prostate MRI and CAD development.

AB  - We investigated the pathogenesis of chronic renal fibrosis in cats and dogs using immunohistochemistry. We used the avidin-biotin complex peroxidase (ABC-P) method with antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta1, cytokeratin, E-cadherin, S100A4, alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and nestin to determine whether tubule epithelial cells had undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) that resulted in loss of epithelial cells and an increased number of mesenchymal cells. Although nephrosis was more common in dogs, nephritis was more common in cats; these pathologies developed in both kidneys. We found that EMT participated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis in both dogs and cats.

AB  - Background and Aims Hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive malignancy of the liver and is ranked as the sixth most common cancer worldwide. There is still room for novel markers to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of HCC. Our observations in cancer databases that PLXNC1 is upregulated in HCC led us to investigate the expression profile of Plexin C1 mRNA and protein in HCC cell lines and tissues. Methods: A recombinant protein encompassing part of the extracellular domain of Plexin C1 was used as an antigen for monoclonal antibody development. Transcript and protein levels of Plexin C1 in HCC cell lines were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. In vivo evaluation of Plexin C1 expression in HCC tissues was accomplished by immunohistochemistry studies in tissue microarrays. Results: A monoclonal antibody, clone PE4, specific to Plexin C1, was generated. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed a Plexin C1-based clustering of well-differentiated HCC cell lines. Staining of HCC and nontumoral liver tissues with PE4 showed a membrane-localized overexpression of Plexin C1 in tumors (p=0.0118). In addition, this expression was correlated with the histological grades of HCC cases. Conclusions: Plexin C1 distinguishes HCC cells of epithelial characteristics from those with the mesenchymal phenotype. Compared to the nontumoral liver, HCC tissues significantly overexpress Plexin C1. The newly generated PE4 antibody can be evaluated in larger HCC cohorts and might be exploited for the examination of Plexin C1 expression pattern in other epithelial malignancies.

AB  - Stress ulcers is a trouble complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Although gastrointestinal ulcerations may be attributed to increased HCL secretion in SAH; the exact mechanism of that complication has not been investigated definitively. We studied if vagal network degeneration may cause intestinal atrophy following SAH. Study was conducted on 25 rabbits, with 5 control group (Group-A), 5 SHAM group (Group-B), and 15 SAH group via injection of autologue blood to cisterna magna. Seven animals followed for seven days (Early Decapitated-Group-C) and eight animals followed 21days (Late Decapitated-Group-D). The vagal nodosal ganglia (NGs), Auerbach plexuses and goblet cells of duodenums were examined by current stereological methods and compared statistically. The mean numbers of degenerated axon density/mm(2) of gastric branches of vagal nerves was 8+/-2, 34+/-11, 189+/-49 and 322+/-81 in the Group A, B, C, and D respectively. The mean numbers of degenerated neuron density/mm(3) of NGs was 5+/-2, 54+/-7, 691+/-87 and 2930+/-410 in the Group A, B, C, and D respectively. The mean numbers of degenerated Auerbach neurons 2+/-1, 4+/-1, 12+/-3 and 27+/-5/mm(3) in the Group A, B, C, and D respectively. The mean numbers of degenerated goblet cells/mm(3) were 4.3+/-1.02, 11.5+/-0.26, 143+/-26 and 937+/-65 Group A, B, C, and D respectively. Statistical analysis showed that vagal network ischemia could cause intestinal bleeding and so atrophy in SAH progression. Statistical analyses of groups were; Group-D/Group-A<0.001, Group-D/Group-B<0.005, Group-C/Group-A<0.005. Undiscovered effect of ischemic vagal network injuries should be regarded as a major cause of stress ulcerations following SAH which has not been mentioned in the literature.

AB  - AIM OF WORK This study investigates the factors related to metastasis detection in a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) in patients without clinical axillary involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients who underwent an SLN biopsy after diagnosis with early-stage breast cancer were evaluated retrospectively. The study sample included 64 patients divided into two groups according to the histopathological examination of the SLN biopsy: Group I (positive for axillary metastasis) and Group II (negative for axillary metastasis). RESULTS: The frequency of lymphovascular invasion was significantly higher in Group I (57%) than in Group II (13%) (p=0.003). The progesterone receptor status (p=0.036), tumor T-stage(p=0,047), and Ki-67 index differed significantly (p=0.045) between the two groups. While in univariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion, T-stage and KI-67 index were significant, in multivariate analysis only lymphovascular invasion was found to be significant. No significant differences were found in terms of estrogen receptor and HER2 considering tumor invasion type, histologic grade, vascular invasion, neural invasion, multifocality or bilaterality, hormone receptor status, menopause status, total number of lymph nodes, presence of non-sentinel lymph nodes and the number of SLNs in the groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that lymphovascular invasion is associated with axillary metastasis, based on an SLN biopsy.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study is to shorten the decellularization time of trachea by using combination of physical, chemical, and enzymatic techniques. Methods: Approximately 3.5-cm-long tracheal segments from 42 New Zealand rabbits (3.5+/-0.5 kg) were separated into seven groups according to decellularization protocols. After decellularization, cellular regions, matrix and strength and endurance of the scaffold were followed up. Results: DNA content in all groups was measured under 50 ng/mg and there was no significant difference for the glycosaminoglycan content between group 3 (lyophilization+deoxycholic acid+de-oxyribonuclease method) and control group (P=0.46). None of the decellularized groups was different than the normal trachea in tensile stress values (P>0.05). Glucose consumption and lactic acid levels measured from supernatants of all decellularized groups were close to group with cells only (76 mg/dL and 53 mg/L). Conclusion: Using combination methods may reduce exposure to chemicals, prevent the excessive influence of the matrix, and shorten the decellularization time.

AB  - BACKGROUND Determining the extent of damage in vascular avulsion type injuries still represents a challenge for the microsurgeon. Excision of the damaged section is critical for the success of anastomosis. The purpose of this study was to determine which among vascular endothelial and adventitia damage findings is most effective in determining the extent of avulsion injury. METHODS: Varying degrees of avulsion were applied to the aorta of 12 (n = 12) adult female New Zealand rabbits. Avulsion was first determined using adventitial findings and then with endothelial findings. The definitive extent of damage was determined histopathologically. RESULTS: The mean area of the histopathological sections was 16.7 +/- 6.9 mm. The extent of damage measured from the adventitia was 15.8 +/- 7.9 mm (the difference in histopathological examinations was not significant, p = 0.590, paired t-test), while the extent of damage from the lumen was 13.3 +/- 8.2 mm (the difference in histopathological examinations was significant p = 0.004, paired t-test). CONCLUSION: Excision based on adventitia findings is more effective in case of avulsion injury.

AB  - Low-grade epilepsy-associated brain tumours (LEAT) are the second most common cause for drug-resistant, focal epilepsy, i.e. ganglioglioma (GG) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (DNT). However, molecular pathogenesis, risk factors for malignant progression, and their frequent association with drug-resistant focal seizures remain poorly understood. This contrasts recent progress in understanding the molecular-genetic basis and targeted treatment options in diffuse gliomas. The Neuropathology Task Force of the International League against Epilepsy examined available literature to identify common obstacles in diagnosis and research of LEAT. Analysis of 10 published tumour series from epilepsy surgery pointed to poor interrater agreement for the histopathology diagnosis. The Task Force tested this hypothesis using a web-based microscopy agreement study. In a series of 30 LEAT, 25 raters from 18 countries agreed in only 40% of cases. Highest discordance in microscopic diagnosis occurred between GG and DNT variants, when oligodendroglial-like cell patterns prevail, or ganglion cells were difficult to discriminate from pre-existing neurons. Suggesting new terminology or major histopathological criteria did not satisfactorily increase the yield of histopathology agreement in 4 consecutive trials. To this end, the Task Force applied the WHO 2016 strategy of integrating phenotype analysis with molecular-genetic data obtained from panel sequencing and 450k methylation arrays. This strategy was helpful to distinguish DNT from GG variants in all cases. The Task Force recommends, therefore, to further develop diagnostic panels for the integration of phenotype-genotype analysis in order to reliably classify the spectrum of LEAT, carefully characterize clinically meaningful entities and make better use of published literature.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Parameters predictive of biochemical or clinical recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy (RP) were determined as pre-treatment PSA value, pathologic tumor stage, tumor grade and presence of Positive Surgical Margin (PSM), extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion and the status of pelvic lymph nodes. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of additional features in patients undergoing RP in our clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 556 RP operations performed between 2009 and 2016 for prostate cancer at this clinic. Preoperative and postoperative data of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. RP specimens were examined by two pathologists specialized in this subject. Of these patients, 78 (14.02%) patients with PSM were included in the study. The pathology slides of these patients were reassessed. The length of PSM (mm), localization (apex, basis and posterolateral) and Gleason pattern at this margin was determined and statistical correlations with BCR were calculated. RESULTS: The mean follow-up after the RP of 41 patients included in the study was 37.4 +/- 13.2 months. During the follow-up period of the patients, BCR was observed in 16 patients (39.02%). No statistically significant difference was observed in age and prostate volume between the groups with and without BCR development (p > 0.05). Preoperative PSA level was found to be statistically significantly higher in the group with BCR development compared to the group without recurrence (p = 0.004). In-group comparisons in each aforementioned Gleason score groups were performed in terms of BCR development and the preoperative Gleason score in the group with development of recurrence was found to be statistically significantly higher compared to the group without recurrence (p = 0.007). The length of the surgical margin was measured as 7.4 +/- 4.4 mm in the BCR-developing group and 4.7 +/- 3.8 mm in the no-BCR- developing group; it was statistically significantly higher in the group with development of recurrence (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Length and location of the PSM and the Gleason score detected in the PSM region could not predict biochemical recurrence according to the results of this present study. However high preoperative PSA value is an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence.

AB  - BACKGROUND Although postoperative complications occurs after periodontal plastic surgeries, an ideal treatment has not been found to overcome. AIMS: The aim of this study was evaluated the effects of topically applied Oral-norm gel on the healing of excisional wounds. STUDY DESIGN: Animal experimentation. METHODS: Excisional wounds with a 3 mm diameter were made in the center of the palatal mucosa in 63 Sprague Dawley rats. Seven animals were sacrificed at time 0. The remaining animals were divided into an experimental group to which topical Oral-norm gel was applied three times a day, and a control group to which nothing was applied. Seven animals in each group were sacrificed at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days. The mean wound surface area (MWSA) was measured, wound healing and width was evaluated microscopically. RESULTS: The MWSA decreased significantly after 3 days in both groups (p<0.001). After 3 days, the MWSA decreased from 6.62 (2.85) mm(2) to 0.83(1.62) mm(2) in control group and 5.07(0.88) mm(2) to 1.42(1.67) mm(2) in test group on day 7. The wound width decreased significantly on day 7 in both groups (p<0.001), with no further changes by day 14. Both groups had a significant increase in inflammation and vascularization on day 3 (p<0.001), with a reduction thereafter. No significant differences in macroscopic and microscopic measurements were observed between the groups at any time point (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: No positive healing benefits were observed with the use of Oral-norm gel.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Organizing pneumonia is an important disease that is associated with non-specific clinical findings and radiographic appearance. Our aim was to examine the clinical and radiological features, laboratory findings, diagnostic approach, and response to therapy in subjects with cryptogenic (COP) and secondary organizing pneumonia (SOP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed between 2010 and 2016 in our hospital. We analyzed the symptoms, radiological features, pulmonary function tests, laboratory data, bronchoalveolar lavage findings, treatment, and prognosis. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with COP and 19 patients with SOP. The most common causes of SOP were determined as rheumatologic diseases. The most common symptoms were cough (71.4%) and dyspnea (66.1%). Bilateral symmetrical consolidations were the most prominent radiological appearance in both COP and SOP. The general radiographic findings were not different in COP and SOP. However, pulmonary lesions were located rather in the central (p=0.023) and middle (p=0.001) zones in patients with SOP. Corticosteroid (CS) therapy was administered to 34 (60.7%) patients. Two patients showed deterioration despite CS therapy. CONCLUSION: The clinical and radiographic findings, treatment response, prognosis were similar in patients with COP and SOP.

AB  - Chondrolipomas are benign mesenchymal tumors that have two mature tissues simultaneously and emerge as a result of cartilaginous metaplasia in lipomas. They rarely occur in the head and neck area (1%-4%), and occur more frequently in the 60-70 years age group. Although there are cases of the nasopharynx, tongue, lip, and neck reported in the literature, we have been able to find only two cases on tonsils. The case of a 17-year-old male patient, who presented to our clinic complaining of dysphagia and was diagnosed with tonsillar chondrolipoma, is described here, along with the radiological, clinical, and immunohistochemical findings, as well as the review of the literature.

AB  - Nasopharyngeal glial heterotopia is a mass composed of mature neural tissue occurring outside the central nervous system and is extremely rare. The preoperative diagnosis of such a mass in the head and neck region is challenging. In this study, we report a case of a 16-month-old patient presenting with respiratory distress and snoring caused by nasopharyngeal glial heterotopia. Radiologic imaging and histopathology are obligatory for the definitive diagnosis of glial heterotopia. Preoperative evaluation of an intracranial connection is one of the most essential issues in the presence of pediatric nasopharyngeal masses. The gold standard of treatment is surgical excision. Early recognition and early surgical excision by endoscopic or external approach are crucial to relieve respiratory distress and to maintain healthy growth and development.

AB  - Background Primary breast rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) can occur in children. There is a lack of knowledge regarding radiologic findings and added diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of RMS in the literature. Case Report: A 12-year-old girl was diagnosed with primary alveolar RMS of the breast. Gray scale ultrasound revealed posterior acoustic enhancement behind a well-circumscribed, multilobulated hypoechoic mass. Doppler ultrasound revealed increased peripheral and central vascularity. Hypointense septations on T2-weighted image exhibiting more enhancement than the stroma on late gadolinium-enhanced images were striking within a hyperintense mass. A hyperintense hemorrhagic focus on T1-weighted image was present in the absence of any necrosis. Avid enhancement on early postcontrast images proceeding from the periphery to the center was depicted. Conclusion: A rapidly enlarging mass with an echogenic peripheral rim together with posterior acoustic enhancement on gray scale ultrasound, intense vascularity on Doppler ultrasound, axillary lymphadenopathy, and satellite nodules on MRI should raise suspicion. Enhancing central and peripheral septations are suggestive of RMS. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in suspected cases can provide valuable data in the differential diagnosis.

AB  - PURPOSE The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of intratunical injection of platelet rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of Peyronie's disease (PD) in a rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g) were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham, PD, PD + PRP, and PRP. The PD + PRP groups received intratunical injections with 0.1 mL PRP on day 15 (treatment) or day 0 (PRP effect). Forty-five days following transforming growth factor-beta 1 injection, rats underwent pathological examination. Tissues were evaluated histologically for fibrosis grade (Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining), collagen/smooth muscle ratio (Masson Trichrome staining) and type III/type I collagen ratio (Picro-sirius red staining). Statistical analysis was performed by Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square followed by the Mann-Whitney U test for post hoc comparisons. RESULTS: Significant changes were found in all 3 groups compared to the sham group (p < 0.0001 for fibrosis, p = 0.001 for collagen/smooth muscle ratio and p = 0.003 for type III/type I collagen ratio). The values in the PRP group and the findings in the PD group are similar (p = 0.122 for fibrosis, p = 0.221 for collagen/smooth muscle ratio and p = 1.0 for type III/type I collagen ratio). CONCLUSION: This is the first study of PRP on PD. As a result of pathological examinations, PRP shows PD-like effects in rats. PRP may be a cheap, easily accessible, and an effective disease model for PD treatment research.

AB  - Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) is the second most common subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) after classical PTC (cPTC). Follicular thyroid lesions such as follicular adenomas/carcinomas, FVPTC, and noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) pose some diagnostic challenges for FNAC. In this study, we aimed to explore whether FNAC can demonstrate diagnostic clues by re-evaluating cytology slides from histopathologically diagnosed FVPTC cases. A total of 42 patients were enrolled in this study: patients were diagnosed with FVPTC via surgical resection between 2006 and 2016, and all patients were subjected to preoperative FNAC, which was conducted at either a private center or at the teaching hospital of Kocaeli University and reported by the same cytopathologist (NP). Clinical and cytomorphological characteristics were reviewed by both authors .Most cases (76.2%) are diagnosed either Bethesda IV or V. The majority of cases had a high cellularity (38/42; 90.5%), and the most frequent observations were monolayer and large syncytial groups of cells (95.2%). While microfollicular structures were observed in 30 (71.4%) cases, nuclear crowding and large naked nuclei were observed in all cases. Nuclear grooves were sparsely detected in 23 (54.8%) cases, and nuclear pseudoinclusions were detected in only six (14.3%) cases. Because thyrocytes often have a mixed architecture in FVPTC, despite a distinct follicular morphology, we believe that nuclear overcrowding, enlargement, and hyperchromasia in cases presenting with increased cellularity are notable clues for the cytodiagnosis of FVPTC. We believe that the primary aim of FNAC in such cases is to give preoperative diagnosis as either category IV or V. Nuclear crowding, monolayered clusters with large syncytial formations, nuclear enlargement, and hyperchromasia are notable cytomorphologic clues for the diagnosis of FVPTC on FNAC.

AB  - PURPOSE The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathologic features and the prognostic significance of Stage I ovarian clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas arising from endometriotic cysts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with either Stage I ovarian clear cell or endometrioid carcinoma were divided into three groups. *Group 1: Patients with cancers arising from endometriotic cysts *Group 2: Patients with ovarian and pelvic endometriosis *Group 3: Patients without endometriosis Patient characteristics (overall survival and disease-free survival) were compared between groups. RESULTS: Of the 78 patients who participated in this study, 39 were in group 1, 13 were in group 2, and 26 were in group 3. The mean age in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 46 years, 54 years, and 48 years, respectively (p = 0.39). Tumoral characteristics, including capsule rupture, positive cytology, grade, and the presence of synchronous endometrial cancer were similar in both groups. The 5-year overall survival rate in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 100, 90, and 93%, respectively (p = 0.4). Moreover, the recurrence rates did not differ significantly between groups. Furthermore, subgroup analysis of clear cell carcinoma and endometrioid adenocarcinoma separately showed no effect of endometriosis on disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS). CONCLUSION: Clear cell or endometrioid ovarian carcinoma arising from ovarian and/or pelvic endometriosis shares the same clinicopathologic characteristics with their counterparts that do not arise from endometriosis and patients have similar overall and disease-free survival.

AB  - We report follow-up results from the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 HELIOS trial of ibrutinib+bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) without deletion 17p. Overall, 578 patients were randomized 1:1 to either ibrutinib (420 mg daily) or placebo, in combination with 6 cycles of BR, followed by ibrutinib or placebo alone. Median follow-up was 34.8 months (range: 0.1-45.8). Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached for ibrutinib+BR, versus 14.3 months for placebo+BR (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI], 0.206 [0.159-0.265]; P < 0.0001); 36-month PFS rates were 68.0% versus 13.9%, respectively. The results are consistent with the primary analysis findings (HR = 0.203, as assessed by independent review committee, with 17-month median follow-up). Median overall survival was not reached in either arm; HR (95% CI) for ibrutinib+BR versus placebo: 0.652 (0.454-0.935; P = 0.019). Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative response rates were 26.3% for ibrutinib+BR and 6.2% for placebo+BR (P < 0.0001). Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (including grades 3-4) were generally consistent with the initial HELIOS report. These long-term data support improved survival outcomes and deepening responses with ibrutinib+BR compared with BR in relapsed CLL/SLL.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) in healthy school-aged children in the northern region of Cyprus and to investigate the existence of potential markers that may accompany CD. This is the first study to measure the prevalence of CD in the northern region of Cyprus. METHODS: This study included 3792 school-aged children who were between the ages of 6 and 10 years between January 2015 and October 2016. CD was screened using total serum IgA, IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and IgA antiendomysial (EMA) antibodies. Subjects with selective IgA deficiency were further tested for IgG-tTG. Small intestinal biopsies were performed on all subjects with tTG antibody positivity. Risk factors and symptoms related to CD were evaluated using questionnaires in both the CD and control groups. RESULTS: Of the 3792 subjects, 39 were antibody positive (IgA-tTG was positive only in 14 subjects, IgA-tTG plus IgA-EMA in 21 subjects, and IgG-tTG in 4 subjects). IgA deficiency was detected in 11 subjects (0.29%). IgG-tTG was positive in 4 subjects with IgA deficiency (36.3%). Intestinal biopsies were performed on 28 of the 39 seropositive subjects. The biopsy findings of 15 children were consistent with CD (IgA-tTG positive in 3, IgA-tTG and IgA-EMA positive in 10, and IgG-tTG positive in 2). Thus, biopsies confirmed CD in 1:256 children (0.39%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study, which is the first study of school-aged children from the northern region of Cyprus, revealed that CD is a prevalent disease in this region.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Normal voice can be differentiated from dysphonic voices by comparing their characteristics using an established normative database. Pediatric normative data using the Phonatory Aerodynamic System (PAS) have been established in a preliminary study for English-speaking children. However, aerodynamic measures, including physical characteristics varying by geographic region, race, and culture, must be investigated between children with different native languages. Aerodynamic analysis of connected speech requires the collection of language-specific samples and the establishment of language-specific norms. Thus, the main purpose of the present study was to establish pediatric normative data using the PAS for a large pediatric population of healthy Turkish-speaking children of 4-17.11years of age. Another research aim was to determine age-dependent and/or gender-dependent aerodynamic parameters for this pediatric population. METHODS: In total, 120 children were divided into four age groups: Group I, 4-5.11 years; Group II, 6-9.11 years; Group III, 10-13.11 years; and Group IV, 14-17.11years. An equal number of male and female participants were assigned to each group. The PENTAX Medical PAS Model 6600 was used. Descriptive statistics for 56 parameters across six protocols were expressed as mean, standard deviation, and range values. Each protocol was analyzed for age, gender, and age-gender interaction. RESULTS: Age was the most predominant factor, affecting 37 of the 56 aerodynamic parameters investigated. Gender and age-gender factors were observed at an equal frequency, each affecting 16 parameters. Pitch-related parameters were the most altered parameters in each protocol. Age-gender interaction was observed in parameters related to the expiratory airflow. CONCLUSIONS: This study established the normative values of phonatoary aerodynamics for a large pediatric population with a wide age range and developed a normative database for healthy Turkish-speaking children. This is the first study to investigate running speech protocol in aerodynamic assessment.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to evaluate the presence of ghrelin and orexin in the testicular tissue of patients who have undergone microscopic testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) due to idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia. Seventy azoospermic cases were included in this study; serum hormone levels were measured and genetic investigations were performed. The patients were divided into two groups: micro-TESE (+) and micro-TESE (-). The number of Leydig cells and stained cells in the seminiferous tubules were counted under a light microscope, and we analyzed ghrelin and orexin activity. The relationship between serum hormone levels and ghrelin and orexin distributions in testicular tissue was evaluated according to micro-TESE results. While sperm was found in 33 cases (47.1%), micro-TESE was negative in 37 cases (52.9%). Peptide hormone activity in testicular tissue was higher in micro-TESE (+) cases. However, interstitial orexin (p = 0.038) and ghrelin (p = 0.002) activity showed statistically meaningful differences. Many different peptides, genes, and other unknown mechanisms play important roles in testicular function. In particular, the peptides orexin and ghrelin may play regulatory roles in testicular function in humans.

AB  - Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) is a rare, slow-growing, benign lesion of the cerebellum. It is often seen in the second and fourth decades. This disease is extremely rare in childhood. A 6-year-old girl presented with loss of balance. A mass lesion in the right cerebellum was detected by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient underwent surgical removal of the lesion, and the histological diagnosis was dysplastic gangliocytoma (LDD). The patient was discharged without complication, and her balance improved in the follow-up period. In this report, we present this rare occurrence in childhood and discuss the clinical course and management. LDD is very rare in early childhood and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of posterior fossa lesions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Detection rate of thyroid nodules is increasing with the use of new imaging modalities, especially in screening for malignancies. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/ CT)-positive thyroid nodules should be differentiated for malignancy to avoid unnecessary operations and further follow-up. Most trials evaluate the role of SUVmax, but there is no definitive information about the utility of Hounsfield unit (HU) values for prediction of malignancy. This study aimed to evaluate the HU values beside SUVmax for detecting malignancy risk of PET/CT-positive thyroid nodules. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Results of 98 cancer patients who had fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for thyroid nodules detected on PET/CT between January 2011 and December 2015 were assessed. The FNABs and surgical pathological results were recorded. RESULTS: FNABs revealed benign results in 32 patients (32.7%), malignant in 18 (18.4%), non-diagnostic in 20 (20.4%), and indeterminate in 28 (28.5%). Twenty-four patients underwent thyroidectomy. The mean HU values were not significantly different in benign and malignant nodules (p = 0.73). However, the mean SUVmax was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in malignant ones. Area under curve (AUC) was 0.824 for SUVmax; the cut-off value was over 5.55 (p < 0.001), with 80% sensitivity, 84.5% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Our current study demonstrated that HU value does not add any additional valuable information for discriminating between malignant and benign thyroid nodules. We also defined a SUV cut-off value of 5.55 for malignant potential of thyroid nodules detected on PET/CT Arch Endocrinol Metab. 2018;62(4):460-5.

AB  - Cholestasis is a condition wherein bile flow is interrupted and lithocholic acid is known to play a key role in causing severe liver injury. In this study, we performed in-depth analysis of the morphological changes in bile canaliculi and the biological role of villin in cholestasis using lithocholic acid-stimulated HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells. We confirmed disruption of the bile canaliculi in liver sections from a liver allograft patient with cholestasis. Lithocholic acid caused strong cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells, which was associated with abnormal morphology. Lithocholic acid reduced villin expression, which recovered in the presence of nuclear receptor agonists. Furthermore, villin mRNA expression increased following small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of the nuclear farnesoid X receptor and pregnane X receptor. Villin knockdown using siRNA caused cell growth arrest in HepG2 cells. The effect of villin-knockdown on whole-genome expression in HepG2 cells was analyzed by DNA microarray. Our data suggest that lithocholic acid caused cell growth arrest by suppressing villin expression via farnesoid X receptor and pregnane X receptor in HepG2 cells.

AB  - Periostin is an extracellular matrix protein from the fasciclin family that guides cellular trafficking and extracellular matrix organization. Periostin stimulates mature cardiomyocytes to reenter the cell cycle. The molecular mechanism behind such stimulation remains to be explored. A DNA microarray technology constituting 30,429 gene-level probe sets was utilized to investigate effects of recombinant murine periostin peptide on the gene expression pattern in a rat model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial injury. The experiment was performed on 84 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in four groups ( n = 21): (1) control group, (2) only periostin applied group, (3) ISO cardiotoxicity group, and (4) ISO + periostin group. The experiment was continued for 28 days, and rats were killed on days 1, 7, and 28 ( n = 7). Microarray analyses revealed that periostin significantly altered the expression of at least +/-2-fold of 2474 genes in the ISO + periostin group compared to the ISO cardiotoxicity group of which 521 genes altered out of 30,429 gene-level probe sets. Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that multiple pathway networks were affected by periostin, with predominant changes occurring in the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, fatty acid metabolism, and TNF-alpha NF-kappaB signaling pathways. These findings indicate that periostin alters gene expression profile in the ISO-induced myocardial injury and modulates local myocardial inflammation, possibly mitigating inflammation through TNF-alpha NF-kappaB signaling pathway along with a decreased Casp7 activity and apoptotic cell death.

AB  - Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma is a rare lymphoma specific to the gastrointestinal system, arising from intraepithelial T lymphocytes, that is often associated with celiac disease. We report a 53-year-old female patient with no previous disease who presented with severe abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness and abdominal guarding and the patient underwent emergency surgery with a diagnosis of acute abdomen. During the operation, a 20-cm mass was found located on Treitz ligament, invading the duodenum and pancreatic head and perforating the jejunum. Histologically, medium-sized monomorphic atypical lymphocyte infiltration with dark nucleus and narrow cytoplasm was seen in the layers of mucosa, submucosa, muscular wall, and serosa of the duodenum. The final pathological diagnosis was "enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma type 2" based on immunohistochemical and serological findings. Based on the World Health Organization 2008 criteria, enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma has two subtypes. Type 1 enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma is associated with celiac disease and has HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 genotype. Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma 2 enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma seldom occurs and is not associated with celiac disease.

AB  - Malignant insulinomas are infrequent endocrine tumors with miscellaneous clinical courses. In this report, we present a rare case of insulinoma that recurred with solitary hepatic metastasis 15 years after the initial resection of the primary tumor from the pancreas. A 20-year-old woman first presented with the symptoms of hypoglycemia in 1996. The diagnosis of pancreatic insulinoma was confirmed by laboratory findings, and the initial surgery had been performed involving complete enucleation of the pancreatic mass. Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a benign adenoma. After 15 years, the patient experienced symptoms of hypoglycemia again, and laboratory findings and abdominal computed tomography identified a lesion in the liver. Intraoperative ultrasound did not show any lesion in the pancreas, and wedge resection was performed for the hepatic lesion. Postoperative blood glucose levels returned to normal. Histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of liver metastasis of a neuroendocrine tumor. This is the longest interval between primary tumor and the metastasis reported in the literature, for insulinoma. Thus, it should be remembered that long-term follow-up is mandatory for the patients with insulinoma even after resection of the primary tumor. Resection is recommended when a metastatic lesion is observed.

AB  - Goblet cell carcinoid tumor of the appendix is an uncommon neoplasia that shares the histological attributes of both adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumors. Its prognosis has a more aggressive course than the other known carcinoid tumors. Clinical diagnosis of goblet cell carcinoid is seldom made preoperatively. The most common clinical presentation of goblet cell carcinoid tumor is acute appendicitis. In this study, we report a patient on whom right hemicolectomy was performed because of a cacal sessile polyp with high grade dysplasia; goblet cell carcinoid tumor of the appendix was revealed incidentally during microscopic evaluation of the appendectomy specimen. The patient healed uneventfully and no recurrence was observed after the 12-month follow-up period. Careful microscopic examination of the appendectomy specimen is key for the diagnosis of appendiceal tumors such as goblet cell carcinoid, especially in elderly patients.

AB  - Extragastrointestinal stromal tumors that arise in the pancreas are extremely rare and managing them can be difficult, particularly if located in the head of pancreas. This case report aims to contribute to the existing data in the literature regarding extragastrointestinal stromal tumors with rare and unusual locations. We present a 56-year-old man who presented with recurrent mild right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass lesion with a diameter of 10 cm localized in the head of pancreas. Pancreaticoduodenectomy with complete tumor excision was performed. He was discharged on the postoperative day 14. Only 15 extragastrointestinal stromal tumors cases have been reported. Of these 15 cases, tumors were located in the head of pancreas in six cases. Here we report the seventh case of pancreatic extragastrointestinal stromal tumor arising in the head of pancreas and also the largest of these seven tumors.

AB  - Volatile substance addiction and toxic gas inhalation are now an important health problem. The pleasure-based inhalation of butane gas, also known as lighter refill gas, is especially prevalent among children and young people. The most important reasons for this situation are that they are cheap and easy to obtain and lack of legal supervision. The exhaled gas is absorbed through the alveolar surface and rapidly enters the bloodstream and leads to clinical signs. It can cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, hallucinations, and euphoria in the acute phase. In severe cases, bronchospasm, hypoxia, ventricular arrhythmia, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death can occur. Our case is one of the rare cases in the literature that was diagnosed by postmortem histopathological examination. Our case is a 15-year-old girl who was found in front of a tobacco product store. On gross examination, there was a hemorrhagic area under the aortic valve that continued to interventricular septum. There was no coronary artery lesion. Histopathological examination revealed hypereosinophilia and contraction band necrosis in myocardial fibers, which was more intense in papillary muscle. Immunohistochemical studies also supported early myocardial ischemic changes. Upon toxicological examination, butane gas was detected in lung and blood samples.

AB  - BACKGROUND It has been reported in the literature that proinflammatory interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) is increased in cases of testicular ischemia reperfusion (I/R) damage. This information suggests that anakinra, an IL-1beta antagonist, may be effective in testicular I/R damage. OBJECTIVE: In our study, we investigated the effect of anakinra on testicular I/R damage induced in rats with torsion/detorsion. METHODS: The 50mg/kg anakinra+testicular torsion/detorsion (KTD-50) and 100mg/kg anakinra+testicular torsion/detorsion (KTD-100) groups received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg of anakinra, respectively. In turn, the testicular torsion/detorsion (TTD) and sham operation (SOG) groups received a single dose of distilled water as a solvent 1h before ketamine anaesthesia. After the testes of the TTD, KTD-50 and KTD-100 groups were subjected to torsion and detorsion for 4h each, the rats were killed with a high-dose anaesthesia, and their testicles were removed and evaluated through biochemical, gene expression and histopathological examinations. The results were evaluated in comparison with those of the SOG group. RESULTS: The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and IL-1beta showed significant increases in the TTD group, which underwent torsion/detorsion, compared to the KTD-50, KTD-100 and SOG groups. Conversely, the levels of glutathione (tGSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPO) and glutathione s-transferase (GST) were found to be significantly higher in the KTD-50, KTD-100 and SOG groups than in the TTD group. CONCLUSION: Anakinra at a 100mg/kg dose histologically suppressed better oxidative stress and tunica albuginea, germ cell, seminiferous tubule and interstitial damage in the testicular tissue compared to a 50mg/kg dose. Experimental results indicate that anakinra might be beneficial in the attenuation of testicular I/R damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE We aimed to evaluate the contribution of different standardized uptake value (SUV) parameters generated from pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT in the characterization of sinonasal neoplasms with histopathologic correlations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 97 consecutive patients (58 men, 39 women; age range, 20-93 years; mean age, 62 years) with pathologically proven untreated sinonasal neoplasms who underwent FDG PET/CT from February 2010 to August 2017. Semiquantitative analysis of primary tumors were performed to evaluate the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean), and the ratio of the SUVmax of the primary tumor to the SUVmean of mediastinal blood pool, which we refer to here as " SUVratio." Various sinonasal tumor histopathologic subgroups (n = 14) were analyzed. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVratio with the histopathologic diagnosis. RESULTS: Mean values of SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVratio for the sinonasal neoplasms were 16.6 +/- 9.7 (SD), 8.6 +/- 5.1, and 5.9 +/- 3.7, respectively, and each parameter was significantly different between histopathologic types (p < 0.05). Mean values of SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVratio were higher in sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) than in olfactory neuroblastoma, metastasis, and adenoid cystic carcinoma (p < 0.05). Mean values of SUVmax and SUVmean were higher in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) than in olfactory neuroblastoma and metastasis (p < 0.05). Also, mean SUVmax was higher in SCC and SNUC than in poorly differentiated carcinoma (p < 0.05). Mean SUVratio was higher in SCC than in small cell carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that different SUV parameters from FDG PET/CT can be used as so-called "metabolic biopsy" to categorize sinonasal neoplasms into different histopathologic subgroups because it can help in the characterization of some of the more common subgroups of sinonasal neoplasms. However, we found that there is overlap in FDG uptake values among some of the rare histologic subgroups; hence, surgical biopsy is still needed for differentiation of histologic subtypes of aggressive sinonasal masses.

AB  - Burkitt lymphoma manifesting as an intracardiac mass is a rare entity. This report describes the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with an intracardiac mass and tumor thrombosis in the anterior mediastinum that proved to be Burkitt lymphoma. The LMB-96 chemotherapy protocol was given and at the end of the treatment there was still residual mass. A biopsy was performed and the pathology revealed thymus tissue. The patient has been in complete remission for 3 months. Burkitt lymphoma has a short doubling time and an intracardiac lesion can become life threatening. Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial in achieving optimal outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE This study aimed to analyze the immunohistochemical effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on healing of long-bone fractures in terms of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the Ki-67 proliferation index, and radiological and histological analyses. METHODS: Sixteen adult rabbits, whose right femoral diaphysis was fractured and fixed with Kirschner wires, were randomly divided into two groups, control and PRP (groups A and B, respectively). PRP was given to group B at 1 week postoperatively, and all animals were euthanized after 12 weeks. Radiographic evaluations were performed periodically. Cortical callus formation, chondroid and woven bone area percentages, osteoblastic and fibroblastic activities, and mature bone formation were examined. The depths of BMP-2 and VEGF staining were measured. The Ki-67 proliferation index was also calculated. RESULTS: The mean radiological union score of group B was significantly higher than that of group A. There were also statistically significant differences between groups A and B in terms of cortical callus formation, woven bone area percentage, fibroblast proliferation, and mature bone formation. Group B had significantly more cortical callus and mature bone formation with less woven bone and fibroblast proliferation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of BMP-2 and VEGF staining and the Ki-67 index. CONCLUSIONS: PRP had no effect on BMP-2 or VEGF levels with no increase in the Ki-67 proliferation index, although its application had a positive effect on bone healing by increasing callus and mature bone formation with decreased woven bone and fibroblast proliferation.

AB  - BACKGROUND Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) is a precursor lesion of prostate cancer (PC), and PC develops from this suspicious focus or an unsampled malignant gland nearby. However, PC-related molecular alterations that could guide the timing of repeat biopsies and help monitor PC risk in ASAP-diagnosed patients have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to first investigate the expression of seven different PC-related RNAs that included serine 2 (TMPRSS2): erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) gene (TMPRSS2-ERG, T2E) fusion, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), kallikrein related peptidase 3 (KLK3), androgen receptor (AR), prostate cancer specific antigen 3 (PCA3), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and 9. METHODS: PC-related RNAs were evaluated using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) system in pathologically ASAP-diagnosed prostate biopsy cores from 55 patients presenting with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA level of 4-10 ng/mL. RESULTS: We detected that positive T2E fusion status (P = 0.013) and the expression of AMACR (P = 0.016), AR (P = 0.016) and MMP-2 (P = 0.013) were independently and significantly associated with PC risk in ASAP patients. There were also several statistically significant correlations between expression levels. Additionally, we demonstrated that T2E fusion positive ASAP patients with higher MMP-2 expression were more likely to be diagnosed with PC at a subsequent biopsy during the follow-up period (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Although, more clinical validations are needed for the stratification of PC risk in ASAP-diagnosed biopsy cores, our current results indicate that the coexistence of T2E fusion positivity with MMP-2 upregulation may help clinicians adjust their biopsy timetable and/or assessment of PC risk in ASAP-diagnosed patients with a PSA level of 4-10 ng/mL.

AB  - BACKGROUND Glomerular immunoglobulin G deposition in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) has been shown to be associated with adverse renal outcomes. Clinical significance of mesangial immunoglobulin M (IgM) deposition in these patients remains to be proven. METHODS: One hundred patients who had a diagnosis of IgAN between 2001 and 2017 were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups based on mesangial IgM deposition status. Groups were compared for demographic, clinical, and pathologic variables at baseline and in follow-up. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of mesangial IgM positivity on renal survival. RESULTS: IgM-positive group included 51% of participants. Baseline demographic and clinical parameters were not significantly different between groups. Mesangial IgM deposition was significantly associated with a higher segmental sclerosis score (p = 0.008). At last visit, median serum creatinine was higher (p = 0.021) and eGFR was lower (p = 0.006) in IgM-positive group. Nineteen (19%) of all patients reached the combined primary outcome which includes doubling in serum creatinine or evolution to ESRD. Cumulative renal survival was lower (p = 0.001) and resistant disease was more frequent in IgM-positive group (p = 0.026). Renal survival at 15 years was 94.2% and 59.7% in IgM-negative and IgM-positive groups, respectively (p = 0.006). Time-averaged proteinuria (HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.9-4.5; p < 0.001) and mesangial IgM deposition (HR, 13.2; 95% CI 1.9-93.1; p = 0.01) were found to be independent predictors of unfavorable renal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we demonstrated that mesangial IgM deposition independently associated with worse renal outcomes in patients with IgA nephropathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) plays a major role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. In hypoxic conditions, HIF is upregulated and has been shown to activate multiple genes required for cells to adapt to hypoxia. AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), a SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) chromatin remodeling gene has context-dependent tumor-suppressive and oncogenic roles in cancer. We assessed the correlations between the expression and mutations of HIF1A and ARID1A in histopathologically confirmed pituitary adenomas. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 71 patients who had undergone surgery for pituitary adenoma. Patient demographic, radiological, and histopathological features were correlated with HIF1A and ARID1A expression. RESULTS: Most cases were HIF1A positive (62%). No significant correlation was found between HIF1A expression and age, gender, tumor size, bone erosion, hemorrhage, or Ki-67 index. An inverse correlation was demonstrated between HIF1A and cavernous sinus invasion (P = 0.035). ARID1A loss was found in 28.2% of pituitary adenomas. No significant correlation was found between ARID1A and any of the assessed variables. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient cohort, we found that most pituitary adenomas expressed HIF1A. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to assess the presence of ARID1A loss in pituitary adenomas, which occurred in 28.2% of cases. No individual demographic, imaging, or histopathological feature was predictive of ARID1A. Likewise, with the exception of an increased incidence of cavernous sinus invasion, no correlation was found with HIF1A. Given the prognostic value of these markers in other malignancies, their frequency in pituitary adenomas warrants further exploration of their potential role in pituitary adenoma treatment and outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To develop externally validated, reproducible, and generalizable models for distinguishing three major subtypes of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) using machine learning-based quantitative computed tomography (CT) texture analysis (qCT-TA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight RCCs were included in this retrospective study for model development and internal validation. Another 26 RCCs were included from public databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas-TCGA) for independent external validation. Following image preparation steps (reconstruction, resampling, normalization, and discretization), 275 texture features were extracted from unenhanced and corticomedullary phase CT images. Feature selection was firstly done with reproducibility analysis by three radiologists, and; then, with a wrapper-based classifier-specific algorithm. A nested cross-validation was performed for feature selection and model optimization. Base classifiers were the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). Base classifiers were also combined with three additional algorithms to improve generalizability performance. Classifications were done with the following groups: (i), non-clear cell RCC (non-cc-RCC) versus clear cell RCC (cc-RCC) and (ii), cc-RCC versus papillary cell RCC (pc-RCC) versus chromophobe cell RCC (chc-RCC). Main performance metric for comparisons was the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). RESULTS: Number of the reproducible features is smaller for the unenhanced images (93 out of 275) compared to the corticomedullary phase images (232 out of 275). Overall performance metrics of the machine learning-based qCT-TA derived from corticomedullary phase images were better than those of unenhanced images. Using corticomedullary phase images, ANN with adaptive boosting algorithm performed best for discrimination of non-cc-RCCs from cc-RCCs (MCC = 0.728) with an external validation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 84.6%, 69.2%, and 100%, respectively. On the other hand, the performance of the machine learning-based qCT-TA is rather poor for distinguishing three major subtypes. The SVM with bagging algorithm performed best for discrimination of pc-RCC from other RCC subtypes (MCC = 0.804) with an external validation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 69.2%, 71.4%, and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning-based qCT-TA can distinguish non-cc-RCCs from cc-RCCs with a satisfying performance. On the other hand, the performance of the method for distinguishing three major subtypes is rather poor. Corticomedullary phase CT images provide much more valuable texture parameters than unenhanced images.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cell responses and apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis) represent critical arms of the inflammation resolution response. We sought to determine whether these processes might be linked through Treg-cell-mediated enhancement of efferocytosis. In zymosan-induced peritonitis and lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury, Treg cells increased early in resolution, and Treg cell depletion decreased efferocytosis. In advanced atherosclerosis, where defective efferocytosis drives disease progression, Treg cell expansion improved efferocytosis. Mechanistic studies revealed the following sequence: (1) Treg cells secreted interleukin-13 (IL-13), which stimulated IL-10 production in macrophages; (2) autocrine-paracrine signaling by IL-10 induced Vav1 in macrophages; and (3) Vav1 activated Rac1 to promote apoptotic cell engulfment. In summary, Treg cells promote macrophage efferocytosis during inflammation resolution via a transcellular signaling pathway that enhances apoptotic cell internalization. These findings suggest an expanded role of Treg cells in inflammation resolution and provide a mechanistic basis for Treg-cell-enhancement strategies for non-resolving inflammatory diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND Malaria is known to cause acute and deadly complications. However, malaria can cause unforeseen pathologies due to its chronicity. It increases the risk of endemic Burkitt Lymphoma development by inducing DNA damage in germinal centre (GC) B cells, and leading higher frequency of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells in GCs. EBV is well known for its tropism for B cells. However, less is known about EBV's interaction with T cells and its association with T cell lymphoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old Sudanese male admitted to hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, a non-endemic country, with hyperpigmented painful skin rashes on his whole body. A complete blood count and a peripheral blood smear during admission revealed large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) with abnormally higher CD8 T cell numbers. Additional skin biopsy and pathology results were compatible with CD8(+) T cell lymphoproliferative disorder with skin involvement. Patient was treated and discharged. However, a pathologist noticed unusual structures in skin tissue samples. Careful evaluation of skin biopsy samples by polarized microscopy revealed birefringent crystalloid structures resembling malarial haemozoin mainly loaded in macrophages and giant histiocytes. After purification of DNA from the skin biopsy samples, nested PCR was performed for the detection of Plasmodium parasites and Plasmodium falciparum DNA was amplified. Because, the co-presence of EBV infection with malaria is a well-known aetiology of lymphoma, EBV-early RNA (EBER) transcripts were investigated in paraffin-embedded tissue samples and found to be positive in macrophage-like histiocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This is a unique case of malaria and EBV infection in a T-LGL lymphoma patient who presented in a non-endemic country. This case emphasizes the clinical importance of EBV monitoring in T-LGL patients with skin involvement. Notably, Plasmodium infection should be examined in patients from malaria endemic regions by pathological and molecular investigations.

Among these, patients with IBS symptoms were evaluated according to the Roma III criteria. The healthy control group comprised patients with no IBS symptom and had undergone gastroscopy procedure for another reason. The plasma ghrelin level and tissue ghrelin level obtained by immunohistochemical examination of biopsy specimens taken from the gastric antrum and corpus were evaluated in all participants. RESULTS: The mean age of 90 participants was 43.64}12.64 years. The median value of the plasma ghrelin level was 3.29 (1.2-12.7) in the diarrhea group (IBS-D), 1.49 (0.82-7.08) in the constipation group (IBS-C), and 1.5 (0.2-3.7) in the control group. The plasma ghrelin levels between the groups were found to be significantly higher in IBS-D than in IBS-C and the control groups (p=0.001 and p=0.001, respectively). On comparing antral mucosal gland biopsy outcomes among the groups, staining intensity score was found to be significantly high in IBS-C as compared with the control group, whereas no significant difference was observed between IBS-D and the control groups (p=0.020 and p=0.429, respectively). CONCLUSION: The plasma ghrelin level in IBS-D and the staining intensity in the antral mucosal gland in IBS-C were found to be significantly higher. In addition, there was no difference between the groups in terms of ghrelin staining intensity in the gastric corpus.

AB  - BACKGROUND Collagen-based synthetic bone grafts which contain tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and hydroxyapatite (HA), and collagen-based synthetic bone grafts containing only TCP have some advantages compared to autografts. Therefore, these grafts are frequently used to fill bone defects and pseudoarthrosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical, radiological and histopathological effects of TCP-HA and TCP alone + Type-1 collagen in healing lower extremity fractures in a pseudoarthrosis model in rat femurs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 36 female Wistar rats were randomly separated into 4 groups. Group 1 (n = 10) was the control group. A femur pseudoarthrosis model was created in Groups 2, 3 and 4. On the 90th day after the 1st surgery in Group 2 (n = 10), TCP-HA + Type-1 collagen was applied, in Group 3 (n = 10), TCP alone + type-1 collagen was applied, and in Group 4 (n = 6, the placebo group), saline solution was applied. Fixation was performed with an intramedullar pin. After 60 days and clinical and radiological scoring, all animals were sacrificed and a histopathological evaluation of the pseudoarthrosis areas was conducted. RESULTS: In all the clinical, radiological and histopathological measurements used in the evaluations of the differences between the groups, a higher rate of union was determined in Group 2 (TCP-HA). No significant difference was determined between Group 3 and Group 4 in terms of union rates. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical, radiological and histopathological results of this study showed that TCP alone was less effective than TCP-HA in the union of a femur pseudoarthrosis model in rats. The reason for this difference was considered to be hydroxyapatite (HA).

AB  - Objective The prognostic importance of extracapsular extension (ECE) in breast cancer is not yet clear, especially in patients with pathological T1-2 and N1 (pT1-2N1) disease. We aimed to investigate whether the extent of ECE was an independent prognostic factor for survival outcomes in patients with pT1-2N1 breast cancer. Materials and Methods: A total number of 131 patients with pT1-2N1 breast cancer treated between 2009 and 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. A single pathologist re-analyzed the histologic examples of all cases. The extent of ECE was graded from 0 to 4. Results: There was a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes involved and ECE grade (p=0.004). According to the univariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and ECE grade were the significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS); age, number of metastatic lymph nodes, menopausal status, and ECE grade were the prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS). With a median follow-up of 46 months, grade 3-4 ECE seems to be notably associated with a shorter OS and DFS in multivariate analysis. The mean OS was 85 months for the patients with grade 0-2 ECE vs 75 months for the patients with grade 3-4 ECE (p=0.003). The mean DFS was 83 months for the patients with grade 0-3 ECE vs 68 months for the patients with grade 4 ECE (p=<0.0001). Conclusion: This research has shown that the extent of ECE is an important prognostic factor for survival in pT1-2N1 breast cancer patients and grade 3-4 ECE seems to be notably associated with a shorter OS and DFS.

AB  - PURPOSE It is critical to obtain sufficient tissue, both in quality and quantity, in biopsy applications for histopathological review. Our aim was to compare fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and core needle biopsy (CNB) techniques in terms of their diagnostic performance in lymph node biopsies. This was a clinical compilation, and histopathological results from biopsies were also evaluated. METHODS: A total of 242 patients and 246 lymph nodes were prospectively evaluated. All histopathologic specimens were obtained through ultrasonography-guided biopsies performed at our institute between April 2015 and October 2017. Histopathological results were grouped according to diagnostic performance, and the mean performance scores of the two methods were compared. RESULTS: For FNAC, the mean diagnostic score was calculated to be 1.63, whereas for CNB, the mean diagnostic score was calculated to be 1.89. The difference between diagnostic scores of the two techniques was statistically significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: We recommend that interventional radiologists perform vacuum-assisted biopsies if there are no financial hindrances or evidence of psychological issues in patients. We recommend this not only for lymph nodes of malignant appearance but also for those that appear benign.

AB  - Oligodendrogliomas (ODGs) is a diffuse glial tumor that constitutes 4.2% of all brain tumors. Extraneural metastases, sometimes seen in glioblastoma multiforme, are extremely rare in ODG. In this report, we present a 63-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with Grade 3 ODG and had an intracranial mass resected in our clinic 4 years ago. The subject now presented with low back pain and was found to have widespread metastases. The prolongation of patient survival by current treatment regimens has revealed a growing number of ODG patients with metastases. We believe that back pain complaints in patients with ODG should be viewed as an indicator of metastasis.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of different doses of systemic melatonin application on new bone formation during mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) in rats. Mandibular DO was performed on 30 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats, which were randomly divided into three groups: control group (CNT), melatonin dose 1 (MLT-D1), and melatonin dose 2 (MLT-D2). A five-day latent waiting period and a ten-day distraction phase followed the surgery. After the surgery, rats from the MLT-D1 and MLT-D2 groups received 25 and 50 mg/kg melatonin, respectively, at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. The animals were euthanised 28 days after distraction, i.e. at 43 days after surgery. Histological and histomorphometric analyses revealed that the distracted bone area was completely filled with new bone formation in all three groups. The MLT-D2 group exhibited the most new bone formation, followed by MLT-D1 and CNT. The melatonin groups had more osteoclasts than the CNT (p < 0.05). The number of osteoblasts was higher in the melatonin groups than in the CNT group, and the MLT-D2 had more osteoclasts than the MLT-D1 group (p < 0.05). Finally, the osteopontin (OPN) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were higher in the melatonin groups than in the CNT group, and the MLT-D2 had higher OPN and VEGF levels than the MLT-D1 (p < 0.05). This study suggests that systemic melatonin application could increase new bone formation in DO.

AB  - Gorham-Stout disease is a rare bone resorption disease, the etiology and prognosis of which is uncertain but it is thought to be benign. It can involve one or more bones and can cause pain, swelling, deformity and fractures in affected bones. Diagnosis is made with a combination of clinical, radiological and histopathological examinations once other causes of osteolysis have been excluded. Due to its rarity, there is no standard therapeutic approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND Capsule fibrosis is the most important and annoying complication of breast implant surgery. Radiotherapy (RT) used in the local treatment of breast cancer has an increasing effect on the existing fibrous capsule; this is called radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF). In this randomized controlled experimental study, we aim to investigate the reduction effect of superoxide dismutase (SOD) on RIF. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups, all of which were subjected to implant surgery. No additional procedures were done for the control group. The other groups were the SOD group, the RT + SOD group, and the RT group. The capsules were evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS: Although SOD reduced surgery-induced capsule formation, it neither prevented nor reduced significantly RIF. CONCLUSIONS: In an experimental model that resembled breast cancer treatment, we concluded that SOD cannot reduce RIF but is effective in reducing capsular fibrosis around the silicone after implant surgery.

AB  - AIM To determine the effects of lycopene treatment in prevention of diabetes associated inflammatory response and oxidative stress in an experimental model. With this aim we investigated the levels of oxidative stress markers including Malondialdehyde (MDA), and total oxidative status (TOS)together with inflammatory markers including nuclear factor- kappa B (NFKB) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and antioxidants including total glutathione (TGSH), total oxidative status (TOS) and total anti-oxidative status (TAS) levels on eye tissue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Totally 18 albino Wistar male rats (250-280 grams) assigned into three groups, with six rats in each group as follows: healthy group (HG), control group (CG), and lycopene group (LG). The diabetes was induced with alloxan administration in rats of CG and LG. Lycopene (4 mg/kg) was administered to the rats in LG once a day for 3 months. At the end of this period, the animals were sacrificed and their eyes were enucleated for histopathological evaluations. From the tissues, MDA, GSH, TOS, TAS, TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB levels were analyzed. RESULTS: MDA, TOS, OSI, NFKB and TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher, while TGSH and TAS levels were significantly lower in CG compared with HG (p < 0.001). On the other hand in LG; MDA, TOS, OSI, NFKB and TNF-alpha levels were significantly lower, while TGSH and TAS levels were significantly higher compared with CG (p < 0.001). Regarding histopathological findings, although there was severe damage on optic nerve of rats in CG; there was only a slight damage in lycopene administered group. CONCLUSION: For the first time in literature we determined that, lycopene was significantly effective in prevention of augmented inflammation and oxidative stress on eye tissue associated with diabetes, as well as the tissue damage on optic nerve. However, studies investigating the long-term clinical effects of lycopene on diabetic individuals are warranted.

AB  - This study was conducted on 28 male Wistar albino rats to determine the effects of chrysin on methotrexate-induced damage to testicular tissue. Rats were grouped into four groups of seven rats reach: Group 1 (n = 7) was the control group to which no drugs were administered; this group was only provided with food and water. Group 2 (n = 7) was administered 20 mg/kg of methotrexate once intraperitoneally. Group 3 (n = 7) was administered 50 mg/kg of chrysin for 7 days orally. Group 4 (n = 7) was administered 20 mg/kg of methotrexate once intraperitoneally, followed by oral administration of 50 mg/kg of chrysin for 7 days. At the end of the experiment, rats were anaesthetised, rat testes were removed, and spermatozoon was obtained from the cauda epididymis. It was determined that sperm count and motility, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities decreased in the methotrexate group, whereas malondialdehyde, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and nuclear kappa factor B expression levels increased. Furthermore, damage to tubulus seminiferus structures and affusion in germ cells was identified. In the methotrexate + chrysin administered group, sperm count improved, biochemical enzyme levels increased, and structural improvements were observed in testicular tubules. These findings demonstrated that chrysin plays a protective role in testicular damage in rats.

AB  - Background Decision-making for management may sometimes be difficult in acute appendicitis (AA). Various diagnostic scoring systems exist, but their sensitivity and specificity rates are far from ideal. In this study, the determination of the predictors and the effect of radiological data and developing a new scoring system were aimed. Methods: Medical records of patients who were hospitalized for AA between February 2012 and October 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. All data were compared between patients with and without appendicitis. The multivariate analysis was performed to define significant variables and to examine the sensitivity and specificity of each group of predictors including radiological data. A new scoring system (NSS) was formed and was compared with two existing scoring systems: pediatric appendicitis score (PAS) and Alvarado scoring system (ASS) by using reclassification method. Results: Negative appendectomy rate was 11.3%. Statistical analysis identified 21 independently significant variables. The heel drop test had the highest odds ratio. Sensitivity and specificity rates of clinical predictors were 84.6% and 94.8%, respectively. Radiological predictors increased the sensitivity rate to 86.9%. Sensitivity and specificity rates for PAS, ASS, and NSS were 86.8% and 83.9%, 84.7% and 81.6%, and 96.8% and 95.6%, respectively. The "re-assessed negative appendectomy rate" was 6.2% and false positive results were remarkably more common in patients with duration of symptoms less than 24 hours. Conclusion: Radiological data improves the accuracy of diagnosis. Containing detailed clinical and radiological data, NSS performs superiorly to PAS and ASS, regarding sensitivity and specificity without any age limitation. The efficiency of NSS may be enhanced by determining different predictors for different phases of the inflammatory process.

AB  - Objective This study was conducted since the effects of colloid solutions on the renal system remain controversial and need to be adequately studied in animals. We aimed to evaluate the effects of hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) on the kidney tissue of rats with late renal failure due to ureteral obstruction. Materials and methods: Rats were divided into four groups: Group C, control; Group HES, hydroxyethyl starch solution (HES) 130/0.4 (Voluven((R))); Group UUO, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO); and Group UUO-HES, UUO-HES 130/0.4 (Voluven((R))). In the groups with ureteral obstruction, the distal part of the right ureter was accessed and sutured through a lower abdominal incision under ketamine anesthesia. Any signs of late-stage renal failure were evaluated after three weeks. Rats in the HES group and the renal failure-HES group were administered with HES 130/0.4 as a single intravenous dose of 20 mL/kg. After a follow-up of 24 hours, intra-abdominal blood sample was collected, and the rats were sacrificed. Biochemical and histopathological parameters were then evaluated. Results: Ureteral obstruction significantly increased urea and creatinine levels. In addition, when the UUO-HES and HES groups were compared, the administration of HES increased urea and creatinine levels in the UUO-HES group. Nitric oxide enzyme activity and malondialdehyde levels have significantly increased in the UUO groups. In addition, HES significantly increased nitric oxide activity and malondialdehyde levels in the UUO-HES group, in comparison with the HES group. The activity of caspases 3 and 8 was significantly increased in the UUO groups. In addition, HES significantly increased the activity of caspases 3 and 8 in the UUO-HES group, in comparison with the HES group. Light microscopy revealed significant changes in the UUO groups, especially in the obstructed kidneys. Conclusion: If indicated, HES should be used with caution in cases of UUO, but not in the cases of bilateral ureteral obstruction. Other aspects of these findings, including the clinical significance and practical applications, merit further experimental and clinical investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between endometrial hyperplasia and DNA repair gene (XPD, XRCC4, and XRCC1) polymorphisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 114 cases enrolled in the study in 4 groups: simple endometrial hyperplasia (SH) (Group 1), complex endometrial hyperplasia without atypia (CH) (Group 2), complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia (CAH) (Group 3), and normal endometrium (NE) (Group 4). Of these cases, 37 cases had SH, 36 cases had CH, 16 cases had CAH, and 25 cases had NE. To evaluate an association between atypia and DNA repair genes, we consider a group that included both SH and CH, the endometrial hyperplasia without atypia cases (Group 5). Genomic DNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded endometrial tissue collected from the Pathology Department of Gaziantep University Medical School. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method was used for evaluating of XPD (-751), XRCC4 (-1394 and a variable number of tandem repeats in intron 3), and XRCC1 (-399) genes. RESULTS We observed a notable distinction in patients having endometrial hyperplasia without atypia (the SH+CH group) and the CAH group in terms of XPD (-751) gene polymorphisms. A notable contrast was observed in patients with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia (the SH+CH group) and the NE group in terms of XRCC4 (VNTR intron 3) polymorphisms (P=0.026, P=0.018, respectively). CONCLUSIONS It was evident the DNA repair gene XPD and XRCC4 polymorphisms had a role in the pathophysiology of endometrial hyperplasia.

AB  - A large body of observations indicate that there is an inconsistent knowledge of Transfusion Medicine among health care professionals as well as inconsistent knowledge in all aspects of the transfusion process, from blood donation to transfusion on the ward. It is obvious to consider that appropriate education in Transfusion Medicine should be achieved in the education of specialists who will prescribe transfusion on a regular basis (hematologists, critical care specialists, anaethesiologists and others.) However,we also believe that education in Transfusion Medicine should also be delivered to almost all other medical specialists who may prescribe blood components. The variability in education of undergraduates in medical schools is universal most likely due to an absence of a predefined common platform. This paper, therefore, focuses on education at the undergraduate level and advocates coverage of the essential physiology and pathophysiology of blood as applied to blood transfusion as well as the medical and societal aspects of issues related to blood donation. It proposes incremental levels of training in Transfusion Medicine, with what is being therefore referred to as 'A', 'B', 'C' etc. curricula in ascending order of complexity; for example, 'A' and 'B' levels would involve medical, midwifery and nursing students, covering a broad base of the subject: they will be detailed in the present essay; ongoing further curricula will focus on physicians and other professionals working within the area or with responsibility for different aspects of the transfusion chain. It is intended that these courses include aspects of donor care, patient care and the appropriate use, safety and effectiveness of blood products. Next, it is advocated that curricula are addressed not only for high-income countries but also for middle- and low-income ones.

AB  - BACKGROUND Curcumin is found in the rhizomes of the turmeric plant that has been showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemic curcumin therapy on alveolar bone loss in an experimental periodontitis model in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided to 4 groups: 75 mg/kg/daily curcumin (C75; n =8), 150 mg/kg/daily curcumin (C150; n =8), Control (n =8), and Ligated (n =8). Curcumin was administrated using gastric gavage. After 12 days, the rats were sacrificed. Right mandibles samples were histopathologically examined. Alveolar bone loss was measured. Interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were evaluated in the serum samples and gingival homogenates. RESULTS: The measurements of alveolar bone loss in the mandibular molars revealed significantly higher bone-loss values in the Ligated group than the Control, C75 and C150 groups. The IL-1beta levels in the gingival homogenates were significantly increased in the Ligated group compared to those of the Control, C75 and C150 groups. The serum IL- 1beta levels in the Ligated group were significantly higher than the Control group. The mean osteoblast numbers in the Ligated group were lower than those of the Control, C75 and C150 groups. The C150 groups showed significantly more osteoblasts than the Control group. The osteoclast numbers in the Ligated group increased significantly compared to the C75, C150 and control groups. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that systemic administration of curcumin at the 75 and 150mg/kg doses reduced alveolar bone loss in the periodontal disease in rats.

AB  - The composite tumors of the liver are very rare, including the coexistence of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) with NEC (neuroendocrine carcinoma). The rare occurrence of these tumors necessitates more reported cases in order to fully understand their clinical characteristics, behaviors and treatments. Herein is described an incidental collision tumor of HCC-NEC, along with a review of the literature focusing on their clinicopathological findings and prognosis. The tumor presented here was found incidentally in the hepatectomy specimen of a 56-year-old man who had undergone liver transplantation for rapidly progressive liver failure because of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Imaging and laboratory examinations did not demonstrate tumor-related findings. During macroscopic examination, two sharply defined and distinctive areas (1.7 cm and 0.6 cm dimension respectively) were detected among the cirrhotic nodules. The characteristic histopathological features and immunohistochemical findings allowed a diagnosis of HCC-NEC to be made. There was no evidence of recurrence and metastasis after 10 months following surgery. The present case and review revealed that these tumors are frequently found in older ages and males. Although serum markers are valuable in the discrimination of malignant tumors, their absence cannot completely rule out composite HCC-NEC. Diagnosis requires a comprehensive histopathological evaluation together with immunohistochemistry. The NEC component might influence the treatment strategy and eventually the outcome of the patient. In conclusion, the rare occurrence of HCC-NEC and the lack of diagnostic clinical signs and symptoms do not exclude their consideration in the differential diagnosis of liver tumors, especially in patients with the chronic liver disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a multifocal angioproliferative tumor involving primarily the skin. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, demographic, histopathological characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcome of 91 KS patients, and compare them with other contemporary research. METHODS: Medical records of 91 KS patients followed between January 2005 and September 2017 were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Most of our patients were male (male-to-female ratio was 4.05). The median age at diagnosis was 69 years (range, 6-93 years). The duration of the lesions varied between 3 and 25 years. The lower extremities were the most commonly involved area (51.6%). Of the 91 patients, classic type KS was seen in 75 patients. Radiotherapy was used successfully in approximately half of our patients. Recurrence was observed in approximately one third of the patients. All KS patients in this study except 1 were classic KS. CONCLUSION: The clinical and demographic characteristics of our patients were compatible with the previous literature suggesting that KS is a tumor that tends to be limited to the skin. Close follow-up of patients is important to monitor for recurrence. This is the largest report from Turkey to date.

AB  - BACKGROUND Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma (SEP) is a plasma cell neoplasm located outside the bone. It is rarely observed in the intracranial area. It is very difficult to diagnose this condition radiologically before surgery. In addition, dural SEP is usually misdiagnosed. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of plasmacytoma that presented as altered mental status after head trauma, located in the subdural area. We also describe its differential diagnosis and treatment by total removal and adjuvant radiotherapy. The 66-month follow-up findings showed distant plasmacytoma development, which was treated with radiotherapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: Some pathological entities should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute subdural hematomas. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of dural SEP mimicking acute subdural hematoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND Main prognostic factors of improved survival after pulmonary metastasectomy (PM) for osteogenic and soft tissue sarcomas are suggested as histological type, number and size of pulmonary nodules, and disease-free interval (DFI). METHODS: Sixty-nine patients who underwent PM between January 1999 and December 2017 were evaluated retrospectively. Relations between parameters and prognostic risk factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated. RESULTS: Osteosarcoma was the most common histologic type (36.2%) and 21 of 25 cases were seen under the age 20 years (p < 0.001). Comparison of patient groups including osteosarcoma and nonosteosarcoma patients showed significant difference according to age (p < 0.001), nodule size (p = 0.033), ratio of surgical margin to nodule size (p = 0.007), and DFI (p = 0.039). Univariate analysis showed that the number of nodules (p = 0.008), ratio of surgical margin to nodule size (p = 0.001), and localization of nodule (p = 0.039) were significant factors associated with DFS. Also, nodule size (p = 0.042), number of nodules (p = 0.003), ratio of surgical margin to nodule size (p < 0.001), and laterality (p = 0.027) were significant prognostic factors associated with OS. Cut-off values of ratio of surgical margin to nodule size for DFS and OS were calculated as 0.94. Logistic regression analysis determined the ratio of surgical margin to nodule size as the common significant risk factor for DFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the ratio of surgical margin to nodule size >/= 1 should be taken as a common risk factor for DFS and OS. Therefore, resection of nodules with the possible widest surgical margin is an important point of PM.

AB  - Cellulose synthase A (CESA) is a key enzyme involved in the complex process of plant cell wall biosynthesis, and it remains a productive subject for research. We employed systems biology approaches to explore structural diversity of eudicot CESAs by exon-intron organization, mode of duplication, synteny, and splice site analyses. Using a combined phylogenetics and comparative genomics approach coupled with co-expression networks we reconciled the evolution of cellulose synthase gene family in eudicots and found that the basic forms of CESA proteins are retained in angiosperms. Duplications have played an important role in expansion of CESA gene family members in eudicots. Co-expression networks showed that primary and secondary cell wall modules are duplicated in eudicots. We also identified 230 simple sequence repeat markers in 103 eudicot CESAs. The 13 identified conserved motifs in eudicots will provide a basis for gene identification and functional characterization in other plants. Furthermore, we characterized (in silico) eudicot CESAs against senescence and found that expression levels of CESAs decreased during leaf senescence.

AB  - Root metastases of solid organ carcinomas are rare entities. Because of their rare occurrence, they can be confused with nerve sheath tumors, such as schwannomas or neurofibromas, when detected by magnetic resonance imaging. In this paper, we reported a case of a 72-year-old woman with S1 root metastasis originating from lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we reviewed the literature and presented the diagnosis and treatment stages of this pathology. Surgical resection should be the main treatment for symptomatic metastases. Gross total resection of tumors is usually not possible with preservation of neurologic functions. Nerve root decompression, subtotal resection, and adjuvant treatments seem to represent the best treatment option for these patients.

AB  - Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms constitute a diagnostic spectrum ranging from adenoma to mucinous adenocarcinoma. To date, many classification systems have been proposed to reflect the histomorphological diversity of neoplasms in this range and their clinical correspondence, and also to form a common terminology between the pathologist and clinicians. The aim of this review is to provide an updated perspective on the pathological features of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. Using the 2016 Modified Delphi Consensus Protocol (Delphi) and the Eighth Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 19 cases presented from June 2011 to December 2016 were evaluated and diagnosed with appendiceal mucinous neoplasia. According to the Delphi, non-carcinoid epithelial tumours of the appendix were categorized in eight histomorphological architectural groups. These groups are adenoma, serrated polyp, low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm, high-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm, mucinous adenocarcinoma, poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring, signet-ring cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The most common symptom was right lower quadrant pain. The median age of these cases was 60+/-15 years. There was a preponderance of females (F/M: 15/4). In our re-evaluation, six cases were diagnosed as serrated polyp. There were 11 cases in the LAMN group and two cases in the mucinous adenocarcinoma group. Using the Delphi and the AJCC manual, there were many changes in the classification, evaluation and treatment of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. These classification systems have facilitated the compatibility and communication of clinicians and pathologists and have guided clinicians on treatment methods.
