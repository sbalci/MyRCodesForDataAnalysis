TI  - Burkitt Leukemia With Precursor B-Cell Immunophenotype and Dual Translocation of 
      t(14;18) and t(8;14) in a Child: Case Report and Review of the Literature.
LID - 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001354 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burkitt leukemia (BL) with the precursor B-cell immunophenotype is a 
      rarely reported condition. The prognosis of such patients is similar to that of
      classic BL. However, the combination of chromosomal translocations associated
      with bcl-2 and c-myc rearrangement has a poor prognosis. OBSERVATIONS: An
      11-year-old child presented with fever and weakness. Bone marrow aspiration
      showed morphologically L1 type blasts and flow cytometry analysis was compatible 
      with precursor B-cell immunophenotype. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a
      combination of t(8;14) and t(14;l8). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of t(8;14) and 
      t(14;l8) can exhibit different immunophenotypical and morphologic features in
      leukemias.

TI  - Heterotopic chondroid tissue of the main bile duct mimicking Klatskin tumor: case
      report and review of the literature.
LID - 10.1007/s12328-018-00928-w [doi]
AB  - Heterotopic tissue in the bile duct is a very rare condition. There are a few
      case reports of heterotopic tissue including gastric and pancreatic cells.
      However, we could not find any data regarding heterotopic chondroid tissue
      obstructing the common bile duct in the literature. A 56-year-old woman was
      admitted to our hospital with complaints of progressive jaundice and pruritus.
      Laboratory test results were within the normal limits except bilirubin and
      alkaline phosphatase which were 10.8 mg/dL and 256 IU/L, respectively. Endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) and computed tomography (CT) revealed a biliary
      stricture confined to the upper part of the common bile duct. The patient was
      operated as soon as the bilirubin level dropped below 5 mg/dL by percutaneous
      transhepatic cholangiography. Despite the lack of a precise confirmation, the
      patient was prepared for operation considering the possibility of a malignant
      biliary tumor since the radiographic mass findings together with
      hyperbilirubinemia were highly suggestive of malignancy. The patient underwent
      total extrahepatic bile duct resection and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, and was
      discharged without any postoperative complications. Histologic examination of the
      bile duct and the nodule revealed the presence of a well-demarcated chondroid
      tissue within the subepithelial connective tissue. Herein, we presented the first
      case, to our knowledge, of heterotopic chondroid tissue of the common bile duct
      in the literature. It is a benign condition that should be considered in the
      differential diagnosis of stricture and mass-forming lesions of the bile duct.

TI  - Diagnostic Value of S100p, IMP3, Maspin, and pVHL in the Differantial Diagnosis
      of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Normal/chronic Pancreatitis in Fine
      Needle Aspiration Biopsy.
PG  - 247-251
LID - 10.4103/JOC.JOC_18_17 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Differentiation between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
      from benign mimickers is a well-known problem in cytological materials. Recent
      studies incorporated biological markers into this question and some studies
      showed that expression of S100P, IMP3, and maspin as well as nonexpression of von
      Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) were significantly correlated with PDAC. In
      this study, we aimed to investigate diagnostic value of maspin, IMP3, S100P, and 
      pVHL immunostaining in fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) of pancreatic
      lesions. Materials and Method: In all, 33 cases of FNAB cell blocks of PDAC and
      34 cases of surgical non-neoplastic pancreas specimens which were retrieved from 
      the archives slides from 2007 to 2011 were included in this study. All the cases 
      were stained with maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL. Expression patterns of markers
      were scored and compared with benign mimickers. Test performance of each antibody
      and possible antibody combinations were also evaluated. Results: The study was
      composed of 33 PDAC and 34 control cases (8 chronic pancreatitis, 3 mucinous
      cystic neoplasm, and 23 nontumoral pancreatic tissue of PDAC). Diagnostic
      sensitivity for malignancy in S100P, IMP3, and maspin was 84.8%, 81.8%, and
      87.5%, respectively. Specificity of these three markers was 100%. Sensitivity and
      specificity of pVHL for detecting nontumoral pancreatic tissue were 100% and
      81.8%, respectively. When maspin, IMP3, and S100P expression were used together
      as triple test, sensitivity was 62.5% and specificity 100%. However, when any two
      of each three markers were evaluated (triple test/dual response), sensitivity
      reached 93.8% and specificity 100%. Conclusion: We observed that dual response in
      triple test (positive staining with two of these three markers) of maspin, IMP3, 
      and S100P immunocytochemistry is very sensitive and specific in differential
      diagnosis of PDA and non-neoplastic pancreatic lesions. pVHL may have an
      additional role, when triple assessment is not satisfactory.

TI  - Resveratrol inhibits Src tyrosine kinase, STAT3, and Wnt signaling pathway in
      collagen induced arthritis model.
LID - 10.1002/biof.1463 [doi]
AB  - Resveratrol, a phytochemical, acts several cellular signaling pathways and has
      anti-inflammatory potentials. The purpose of this study is to research the
      therapeutic effect of resveratrol in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in
      rats and whether resveratrol affects the activities of signaling pathways those
      are potent pathogenic actors of rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis was induced by
      intradermal injection of chicken type II collagen combined with incomplete
      Freund's adjuvant in Wistar albino rats. One day after the onset of arthritis
      (day 14), resveratrol (20 mg/kg/day) was given via oral gavage, until day 29. The
      paws of the rats were obtained for further analysis. Tissue Wnt5a,
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Src tyrosine kinase and signal
      transducer, and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) mRNA expressions were
      determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Resveratrol ameliorated the
      clinical and histopathological (perisynovial inflammation and cartilage-bone
      destruction) findings of inflammatory arthritis. The tissue mRNA expressions of
      Wnt5a, MAPK3, Src kinase, and STAT3 were increased in the sham group compared to 
      the control group. Resveratrol supplement decreased their expressions. The
      present study shows that Src kinase, STAT3, and Wnt signaling pathway are active 
      in the CIA model. Resveratrol inhibits these signaling pathways and ameliorates
      inflammatory arthritis. (c) 2018 BioFactors, 2018.

AB  - Ewing's family of tumors is aggressive tumors and frequently arises from bone and
      soft tissue. They might also arise from nonosseous structures such as
      gastrointestinal tract, adrenal glands, or kidney. Primary renal Ewing's sarcoma 
      (ES)/primitive neuroectodermal tumor is an extremely rare entity which has
      aggressive clinical course. These high-grade malignant tumors predominantly
      affect adolescents and young adults. Patients mostly present with nonspecific
      symptoms such as pain, hematuria, mass, and sensitivity. It is confused with
      renal cell cancer in imaging techniques. The definitive diagnosis is based on the
      histopathological examination. Surgical or radiotherapy treatment is used for
      local control and multiagent chemotherapy used for systemic treatment. Despite
      all treatment options, prognosis is poor. We aimed to describe the diagnosis and 
      follow-up and treatment of renal ES case that was considered as renal cell
      carcinoma in imaging but diagnosed as ES via histopathology.

      cell cervical cancer treated with radical radiotherapy.
PG  - 1373-1378
LID - 10.4103/0973-1482.203602 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Increased levels of endoglin may represent a new reagent of active 
      neovascularization and angiogenesis process in various cancer types. The
      prognostic value of tumor CD105 (endoglin) expression in cervical squamous cell
      cancer (CSCC) patients treated with radical radiotherapy (RT) +/- chemotherapy
      was investigated. Materials and Methods: CD105 (endoglin) expression was assessed
      by immunohistochemical methods in seventy patients, who were treated with radical
      RT +/- chemotherapy for CSCC. The prognostic effects of CD105 on patient and
      treatment characteristics, local-regional control, and survival were assessed.
      Results: The median follow-up was 24 (5-99) months for the whole cohort. The
      median CD105 microvessel density was 55.5 (range; 12-136). Age (</=61 vs. >61
      years; P = 0.015), lymph node metastasis status (absent vs. present; P = 0.028), 
      International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (Ib-IIa vs. IIb-IVa; 
      P = 0.036), cycles of concurrent chemotherapy (1-3 vs. 4-6 cycles; P = 0.001),
      and hemoglobin levels (</=10 g/dL vs. >10 g/dL; P = 0.006) appeared to associate 
      significantly with overall survival on univariate analysis. Discussion: No
      correlation was identified between the tumor CD105 (endoglin) expression and
      survival in CSCC patients treated with radical RT +/- chemotherapy.

TI  - Use of peritoneal washing cytology for the detection of free peritoneal cancer
      cells before and after surgical treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 1225-1229
LID - 10.4103/0973-1482.184518 [doi]
AB  - Aim: Cytological detection of peritoneal-free gastric cancer cells is considered 
      as the gold standard with variable sensitivity. Seeding of cancer cells after
      radical surgery for gastric cancer is a controversial issue. In this study, it
      was aimed to detect the rate of positive peritoneal washing cytology and the
      incidence of spreading of tumor cells after radical surgery. Materials and
      Methods: Patients with pathologically proven and surgically treated gastric
      adenocarcinoma were enrolled. Three peritoneal washing samples were examined
      cytologically: at the beginning, after completion of resection, and before
      closure of the abdomen. Identification of peritoneal-free gastric cancer cells
      was regarded as the main outcome. Results: Thirty-four patients with a mean age
      of 60.7 +/- 12 years were enrolled. T3 and N0 were the most common stages seen in
      16 (47%) and 12 patients (35.3%), respectively. There were two positive results
      (5.9%) as the first peritoneal sample. Considering T3- or N-positive patients,
      the incidence increased to 9.1%. There was no conversion of negative to positive 
      cytology. Cytological positivity remained only in one case (2.9%) after the
      second and the third peritoneal samples. Conclusion: Rate of positive peritoneal 
      washing cytology in patients with gastric cancer is influenced by
      clinicopathological findings and the technique used. Use of cytology alone is
      thought to be failed to detect free cancers cells within the peritoneal cavity.

TI  - A cancer of undetermined significance: Incidental thyroid carcinoma.
LID - 10.1002/dc.24117 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing which can be
      attributed in part to improved ultrasonography (US) methods and increased
      detection of incidental thyroid carcinomas (ITC). We aimed to compare ITC with
      nonincidental thyroid carcinomas (NITC) in this study. METHODS: Retrospective
      analyses of 906 individual patients who were operated for benign and malignant
      thyroid disease and had a final histopathological diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma 
      were enrolled in this study. Preoperative US examination and fine needle
      aspiration (FNA) biopsy results were evaluated. The tumor foci in thyroidectomy
      specimens that were not represented in preoperative US or FNA reports were
      classified as ITC. The tumor foci that match with the lesions defined in US or
      FNA results were classified as NITC. RESULTS: Final histology revealed ITC in 326
      patients (36%) and NITC in 580 patients (64% Mean age was 51.7 +/- 11.11 in ITC
      group and 48.15 +/- 13.1 in NITC group (P < .001). In NITC group 322 (55.5%) of
      the patients were operated for suspicious cytology while only 29 (8.9%) of the
      patients in the ITC group were operated because of this indication (P < .001).
      There were 1301 cancer foci in histopathology specimens. Among all these cancer
      foci, 434 (33.3%) were detected incidentally and 867 (66.7%) were detected
      non-incidentally. About 779 (89.9%) of nonincidental cancer foci were papillary
      cancer (PTC), while all of the incidental cancer foci were PTC. Mean size was 13 
      mm in NITC group and it was 3 mm in the ITC group and differed significantly
      between the groups (P < .001). Tumor size was </=1 cm in 35.2% of the patients
      with NITC while 98.5% of patients with ITC had tumor </=1 cm. The occurrence of
      multinodularity was higher in ITC than the NITC group (P < 001). Median TSH level
      was higher in patients with NITC than ITC while both were in the reference range 
      (1.53 vs 1.03 muIU/mL, P < .001). The frequency of thyroiditis detected by US,
      and thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroglobulin antibody positivities were
      similar in patients with ITC and NITC (P = .2, P = .86, and P = .26,
      respectively). The frequencies of capsular invasion (29.1% vs 7.9%),
      extrathyroidal extension (13% vs 4.2%), multifocality (35.8% vs 24.2%),
      non-complete resection (9.2% vs 1.8%), and lymph node metastasis (9.5% vs 1.8%)
      were significantly higher in the NITC group (P < .001, for each).
      Persistent/recurrent disease in patients with NITC was more frequent than
      patients with ITC (P = .004). This outcome was similar for cancers measuring </=1
      cm (P = .001). CONCLUSION: ITC is often encountered in older patients and
      frequently determined in early stages with more favorable histopathological
      features and better prognosis.

TI  - The amendatory effect of hesperidin and thymol in allergic rhinitis: an
      ovalbumin-induced rat model.
LID - 10.1007/s00405-018-5222-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Allergic rhinitis is an immunoglobulin-E (Ig-E)-mediated response driven
      by type 2 helper T cells. Hesperidin and thymol are biological agents that
      possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. The purpose of this
      study was to investigate the effects of hesperidin and thymol in rats with
      ovalbumin-induced allergic rhinitis. METHODS: Thirty adult Sprague-Dawley rats
      were randomly assigned into five groups, each containing six animals. The first
      group constituted the negative control group, while the remaining groups were
      exposed to an ovalbumin-induced model of allergic rhinitis. In the provocation
      stage, 4 mL/kg saline was administered to the positive control group, 10 mg/kg
      desloratadine to the reference group, 100 mg/kg hesperidin to the hesperidin
      group, and 20 mg/kg thymol to the thymol group, all by gastric lavage for 7 days.
      Nasal symptoms were scored on day 22. Rats were then sacrificed, and intracardiac
      blood specimens were collected to measure plasma total Ig-E, IL-5, IL-13, total
      antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant status (TOS) levels. Nasal tissues 
      were extracted for histopathological and immunochemical examination. RESULTS:
      Nasal symptom scores were highest in the positive control group, while hesperidin
      and thymol ameliorated these symptoms to the same extent as desloratadine. Ig-E, 
      IL-5, IL-13, and TOS levels increased, while TAC levels decreased significantly
      in the allergic rhinitis group compared to the other groups. Significant
      improvement in these parameters was observed in both the hesperidin and thymol
      groups. At histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the nasal
      cavity, severe allergic inflammation and severe TNF-alpha expression was
      determined in rats from the allergic rhinitis group. Mild inflammatory changes
      and mild TNF-alpha expression were observed in all three treatment groups.
      CONCLUSION: Both hesperidin and thymol were effective in suppressing allergic
      symptoms and inflammation in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of cone beam CT and micro-CT on blooming artifacts in
      human teeth filled with bioceramic sealers.
LID - 10.1007/s00784-018-2748-8 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess blooming artifacts caused by root canal sealers in CBCT images
      compared with those that appeared in micro-CT scan images used as references.
      MATERIALS AND METHOD: Thirty freshly extracted human mandibular central incisors 
      were used. Root canals were prepared with nickel titanium files with an ISO size 
      40/0.06 taper and filled with a single cone (40/0.06 taper) and three different
      sealers. The samples were divided into the following three groups with 10 roots
      each: (I) AH Plus sealer; (II) Sure Seal Root; and (III) Total BC sealer. Teeth
      were scanned with the same voxel sizes (0.2 mm) in different CBCT devices and the
      micro-CT images were acquired as reference images. RESULTS: Significantly
      different results in terms of blooming artifacts were detected between CBCT and
      micro-CT images, as well as among the CBCTs images. The canals filled with AH
      Plus sealer showed more blooming artifacts than those filled with bioceramic
      sealers (p < 0.05). Additionally, the worst blooming artifact was observed when
      the images were acquired with lower kilovoltage peak. CONCLUSION: The appearance 
      of blooming artifacts is dependent on sealer and CBCT, and their effects are
      significantly worse than they are in micro-CT images. The differential effect of 
      different sealers and distinct CBCT protocols should be further investigated to
      enable the use of bioceramic sealers without a significant impact on
      post-treatment imaging. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Root canal sealers showed a different
      extent of blooming artifact in CBCT images. Hence, researchers and clinicians
      should be aware of these artifacts before conducting endodontic evaluations using
      CBCT images.

TI  - The factors predicting upgrading of prostate cancer by using International
      Society for Urological Pathology (ISUP) 2014 Gleason grading system.
LID - 10.5152/tud.2018.57946 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors to predict Gleason score upgrading (GSU) of
      patients with prostate cancer who were evaluated by using the International
      Society for Urological Pathology (ISUP) 2014 Gleason grading system. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2015, we retrospectively investigated 
      patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy and followed up in the
      uro-oncology outpatient clinic. The pathologic specimens of the patients were
      evaluated based on the ISUP 2014 classification system. The patients were divided
      into two groups with or without upgraded Gleason scores. Factors that could be
      effective in predicting upgrading such as age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA),
      prostate volume, D'Amico risk classification, PSA density, cancer of the prostate
      risk assessment (CAPRA) scores, biopsy tumor percentage, body mass index, and
      clinical stage parameters were compared between both groups. RESULTS: Of the 265 
      patients who could be evaluated and followed up regularly, Gleason score upgrades
      were observed in 110 (41.5%) patients. Advanced age (p=0.009), PSA >20 ng/mL
      (p=0.036), PSA density >0.35 (p=0.005), high CAPRA score (p=0.031), and high
      biopsy tumor percentage (p=0.009) were discovered to be correlated with Gleason
      score upgrade in univariate logistic regression analysis. Advanced age alone was 
      a predictor for GSU in multivariate logistic regression analysis (p=0.002).
      Five-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 86% in the non-GSU group 
      and 55% in the GSU group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: GSU risk should be taken into
      consideration in making therapeutic decisions for older patients with prostate
      cancer, and precautions should be taken against development of aggressive
      disease.

TI  - What is the protective effect of krill oil on rat ovary against
      ischemia-reperfusion injury?
LID - 10.1111/jog.13876 [doi]
AB  - AIM: In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of krill oil
      (KO) against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury on rat ovary. METHODS: This study 
      was conducted with 32 Wistar Albino rats. Rats were divided into four groups,
      with eight rats in each group-as follows: Sham group, I/R group, I/R + low dose
      KO group (50 mg) and I/R + high dose KO group (500 mg). The histopathological and
      follicle counts were performed on the right ovary. The total antioxidant status, 
      total oxidant status and oxidative stress index were evaluated on the left ovary.
      And also serum N-thiol level, serum T-thiol level, serum disulfide (SDS) level,
      serum disulfide/N-thiol and serum disulfide/T-thiol ratios were evaluated too.
      RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was determined between the I/R
      group and all the other groups for all parameters. There was significant
      difference between KO groups and the Sham group for the parameters of serum
      N-thiol, serum T-thiol, SDS, serum disulfide/N-thiol and serum disulfide/T-thiol.
      SDS, total oxidant status and oxidative stress index were determined to be the
      highest in the I/R group and the lowest in the low dose KO group. The total
      antioxidant status values were found to be the highest in the high dose KO group 
      and the lowest in the I/R group. Follicle counts and histological injury scores
      showed no significant difference between Sham and KO groups. CONCLUSION: This
      study demonstrated that KO has beneficial effects on decreasing the injury after 
      I/R on rat ovary.

TI  - Dual actions of the antioxidant chlorophyllin, a glutathione transferase P1-1
      inhibitor, in tumorigenesis and tumor progression.
LID - 10.1002/jcb.27974 [doi]
AB  - Glutathione (GSH) and enzymes related to this antioxidant molecule are often
      overexpressed in tumor cells and may contribute to drug resistance. Blockade of
      glutathione transferases (GSTs) has been proposed to potentiate the efficacy of
      chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effect of chlorophyllin that has antioxidant properties, and also interferes with
      the activity of GST P1-1, on breast cancers in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo
      studies were conducted using an N-methyl- N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced chemical
      carcinogenesis model in laboratory rats. DNA damage, GST activity, and GSH levels
      were determined in liver and tumor tissues. Treatment with chlorophyllin
      increased the GSH levels in the liver and significantly decreased DNA damage in
      the blood, liver, and tumor tissues. Even though tumorigenesis was delayed in
      rats receiving chlorophyllin before MNU injections, once the tumors emerged, the 
      progression of tumor appeared to be faster than in the animals that received the 
      carcinogen only. Out of nine breast cell lines, GST P1-1 expression was detected 
      in MCF-12A, MDA-MB-231, and HCC38. Concomitant incubation with chlorophyllin and 
      docetaxel did not significantly affect cell proliferation and viability.
      Chlorophyllin displayed genoprotective effects that initially delayed
      tumorigenesis. However, once the tumors were established, it may act as a
      promoter that facilitates tumor growth, potentially by a mechanism independent of
      cell proliferation and viability. Our results underline the pros and cons of
      antioxidant treatment in cancer, even if it has a capacity to inhibit GST P1-1.

TI  - European perspective on the 2015 American Thyroid Association Management
      Guidelines for Adult Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid
      Cancer. Proceedings of an interactive international symposium.
LID - 10.1089/thy.2017.0129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) Management Guidelines for
      Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) are highly 
      influential practice recommendations. The latest revision appeared in 2015 ("ATA 
      2015"). These guidelines were developed predominantly by North American experts. 
      European experts frequently have different perspectives, given epidemiological,
      technological/methodological, practice organization, and medicolegal differences 
      between the respective regions. SUMMARY: Divergent viewpoints were the focus of
      an invited symposium organized by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine
      involving 17 European thyroidologists, 4 ATA Guidelines Taskforce members, and an
      audience of 200 international experts. The group discussed "preoperative
      assessment of thyroid nodules," "surgery and role of pathology," "radioiodine
      therapy (RAIT)," "assessment of initial therapy and dynamic risk stratification,"
      and "treatment of persistent disease, recurrences, and advanced thyroid cancer." 
      The dialogue resulted in this position paper contrasting European and ATA 2015
      perspectives on key issues. One difference pertains to ATA 2015's permissiveness 
      of lobectomy for primary tumors </=4 cm. European panelists cited preclusion of
      RAIT, potential need for completion thyroidectomy, frequent inability to avoid
      chronic thyroid hormone replacement, and limitations of supportive evidence as
      arguments against widely applying lobectomy. Significant divergence involved ATA 
      2015's guidance regarding RAIT. European panelists favored wider use of
      post-operative RAIT than does ATA 2015. Rationales included the modality's
      association with favorable patient outcomes and generally limited toxicity, and
      lack of high-quality evidence supporting withholding RAIT. Additionally, European
      panelists favored recombinant human thyrotropin in more settings than does ATA
      2015, citing avoidance of hypothyroid morbidity and quality-of-life impairment,
      without apparent sacrifice in oncologic outcomes. Based on clinicial evidence
      plus theoretical advantages, European experts advocated dosimetric versus
      fixed-activity RAIT approaches for advanced DTC. European panelists noted that
      the ATA 2015 risk stratification system requires information sometimes
      unavailable in everyday practice. ATA 2015 recommendations regarding
      radioiodine-refractory DTC should consider potential palliative benefits of RAIT 
      in patients who also have radioiodine-susceptible lesions. CONCLUSIONS: European 
      panelists suggested modifications to approximately one-third of ATA 2015
      recommendations. Varying European and ATA 2015 perspectives can stimulate
      analysis and discussion of literature and performance of primary research to
      resolve discrepant recommendations and potentially improve patient outcomes.

TI  - The effect of anakinra to nephrotoxicity with cisplatin induced in rats:
      Biochemical, gene expression and histopathological evaluation.
LID - 10.17219/acem/75775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) have been reported
      to play a role in the pathogenesis of nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin.
      OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of
      anakinra, which is an IL-1beta receptor antagonist, on cisplatin-induced
      nephrotoxicity in rats, through biochemical, gene expression and
      histopathological analyses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was designed with 4
      groups. For 1 week, the control group (C) and the cisplatin (Cis) group received 
      distilled water, while the cisplatin + anakinra 50 (Cis + ANA50) group and the
      cisplatin + anakinra 100 (Cis + ANA100) group were intraperitoneally administered
      50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of anakinra, respectively. The Cis, Cis + ANA50 and Cis + 
      ANA100 groups were intraperitoneally injected with a 2.5 mg/kg dose of cisplatin 
      for 7 days. After sacrifice, the kidney tissue of each rat was extracted for the 
      assessment of the malondialdehyde (MDA) and total glutathione (tGSH) levels, and 
      for gene expression analyses of IL-1beta. The kidney tissues were
      histopathologically evaluated. Statistical analyses of the data were performed
      using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The administration of
      cisplatin (the Cis group) yielded a higher level of MDA (4.75 +/-0.25 nmol/mL; p 
      < 0.001) and lower levels of tGSH (1.80 +/-0.35 mg/L; p < 0.001) compared to
      other groups. Cisplatin also increased IL-1beta gene expression (6.33 +/-0.27
      gene expression levels; p < 0.001) compared to other groups. The impact of
      anakinra on the MDA and tGSH levels, and on IL-1beta gene expression induced by
      cisplatin was observed as a reversal of these findings (p < 0.05). Anakinra
      better prevented an increase of the levels of MDA and IL-1beta at a dose of 100
      mg/kg compared to a 50 mg/kg dose. CONCLUSIONS: Anakinra prevents oxidative
      kidney damage induced by cisplatin, in a dose-dependent manner. This result
      suggests that anakinra may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-induced kidney
      damage.

AB  - Progranulin (PGRN) is predominantly expressed by microglia in the brain, and
      genetic and experimental evidence suggests a critical role in Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). We asked whether PGRN expression is changed in a disease severity-specific 
      manner in AD We measured PGRN in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in two of the
      best-characterized AD patient cohorts, namely the Dominant Inherited Alzheimer's 
      Disease Network (DIAN) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      (ADNI). In carriers of AD causing dominant mutations, cross-sectionally assessed 
      CSF PGRN increased over the course of the disease and significantly differed from
      non-carriers 10 years before the expected symptom onset. In late-onset AD, higher
      CSF PGRN was associated with more advanced disease stages and cognitive
      impairment. Higher CSF PGRN was associated with higher CSF soluble TREM2
      (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) only when there was underlying
      pathology, but not in controls. In conclusion, we demonstrate that, although CSF 
      PGRN is not a diagnostic biomarker for AD, it may together with sTREM2 reflect
      microglial activation during the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The conventional radiologic features that differentiate benign from
      malignant bone lesions were originally described using radiography (x-ray [XR]). 
      When evaluating sectional imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), one may apply these principles to identify
      malignant bone lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of
      these radiographic features for detecting malignity when applied to CT and MRI.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by our institutional
      ethical board. Thirty-nine patients with histopathologic proof of a high-grade
      bone malignancy and preoperative imaging data obtained with a minimum of two
      different modalities were included in the study. Four radiologists reviewed the
      images and scored the lesions for distinctness of margins, presence and type of
      periosteal reaction, matrix mineralization, and presence of soft tissue mass. The
      average score for each modality was then tested for accuracy with regard to the
      histopathology. RESULTS: When lesion margins were considered, XR was the best
      modality to detect a high-grade malignancy. MRI, especially postcontrast
      T1-weighted sequence, was the least helpful in this regard. There was no
      significant difference between CT and XR and between CT and MRI. When the
      periosteal reaction was considered, XR was the best modality to detect the
      malignant type of periosteal reaction. In this regard, MRI and CT were
      misleading; either by not detecting or undergrading periosteal reaction. MRI was 
      the best modality to detect soft tissue mass. CONCLUSION: Conventional imaging
      criteria for bone malignancy can be misleading when applied to MRI or CT. When
      cross-sectional imaging features contradict those from XR, the latter should be
      the guide for clinical management.

AB  - Introduction: Granulomatous lung disease (GLD) is caused by a wide range of
      conditions and it is challenge for pulmonologist. A detailed history of exposures
      is fundamental in GDL and has been found pivotal to reach a precise diagnosis.
      Materials and Methods: Between September 2014 and December 2016, the distribution
      of patients diagnosed with granulomatous lymphadenitis in the mediastinal/hilar
      lymph nodes by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or mediastinoscopy was analyzed.
      To be listed as 'confident', a diagnosis of sarcoidosis required compatible
      histological, radiological and clinical findings in conjunction with negative
      cultures. Infectious entities listed as 'confident' had either microorganisms in 
      tissue section, positive culture, positive serology or positive antigen detection
      in a consistent clinical pathological setting. Result: Granulomatous
      lymphadenitis was detected in 110 patients. The included 110 cases consisted of
      70.9% women and median age of 53 (range 44-61) years. The final diagnosis of the 
      patients was accepted to be sarcoidosis in 79 (71.8%), sarcoid like granulomas in
      7 (6.4%), tuberculosis in 4 (3.6%), silicosis in 4 (3.6%), drug-associated
      granuloma in 2 (1.8%), hypersensitivity pneumonitis in 1 (0.9%), Chron disease in
      1 (0.9%), unspecified in 12 (10.9%). Three patients were classified as
      tuberculosis based on culture. Conclusions: In this study, we found that the most
      common cause of granulomatous lymphadenitis was sarcoidosis. Contrary to
      expectations, the number of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis was very low.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Testicular ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury
      develops after torsion and following detorsion of the testis. Reactive oxygen
      species were produced and oxidative damage begins to occur due to I/R process.
      Nimesulide, which is a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor drug, have
      antioxidant, antiinflammatory, analgesics and antipyretic effects. We aimed to
      investigate biochemically and histopathologically effect of nimesulide on testis 
      I/R injury in rats induced by the testicular torsion-detorsion. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: In this study, 24 albino Wistar male rats were divided into four groups 
      (6 rats in each group): ischemia/reperfusion applied+50mg/kg nimesulide
      administrated (NIM-50), ischemia/reperfusion applied+100mg/kg nimesulide
      administrated (NIM-100), ischemia/reperfusion applied (IR) and Sham surgery (SS) 
      groups. Nimesulide was administered to NIM-50 and NIM-100 groups at the 50mg/kg
      and 100mg/kg doses before 2h applied I/R procedures. The IR group were applied
      only I/R procedures, no drug treatment was applied. Animals were sacrificed under
      high dose anesthesia and left testes were extracted. Testes were examined
      biochemically and histopathologically. RESULTS: Total glutathione (tGSH) and
      cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) levels were increased in the NIM-50 and NIM-100 groups
      compared to IR group. The levels of COX-2, malondialdehyde (MDA),
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were
      lower in the NIM-50 and NIM-100 groups than in the IR group. Some
      histopathological changes seen in IR group. This findings were decreased in
      NIM-50 group and prevented in NIM-100 group. CONCLUSION: Nimesulide prevented
      inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results suggest that nimesulide may be
      have a protective effect on testicular I/R injury.

TI  - Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma combined with leiomyoma (stromomyoma): A
      bizarre tumor of the uterus in a premenopausal woman.
PG  - 281-286
AB  - Objective: Uterine sarcomas are very rare malignancies, and when a hysterectomy
      is performed for benign causes, a risk of about 1/500 is mentioned for possible
      uterine sarcomas. Endometrial stromal neoplasms are a rare subgroup of uterine
      sarcomas that account for less than 10% of all uterine sarcomas. Mixed
      endometrial stromal and smooth muscle tumors, also known as stromomyomas, are
      defined as having at least 30% each of endometrial stromal and smooth muscle
      components. As a result, stromomyoma is an extremely rare malignant mixed
      mesenchymal tumor of the uterus. Both clinically and histologically, the
      differential diagnosis is challenging. Stromomyoma should be kept in mind in the 
      differential diagnosis of large uterine masses, even if these masses are seen in 
      an asymptomatic woman of reproductive age. In this study, we aimed to present

TI  - TGF-beta-SMAD-miR-520e axis regulates NSCLC metastasis through a TGFBR2-mediated 
      negative feedback loop.
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgy166 [doi]
AB  - Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) pathway plays crucial roles during the
      carcinogenesis and metastasis. Transforming growth factor-beta receptor 2
      (TGFBR2) is a key molecule for the regulation of TGF-beta pathway and frequently 
      downregulated or lost in several cancer types including non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) and TGF-beta pathway is often regulated by negative feedback
      mechanisms but little is known about the mechanism of TGFBR2 downregulation in
      NSCLC. Here, we found that the expression of miR-520e is upregulated in
      metastatic tumor tissues compared to non-metastatic ones and its expression is
      inversely correlated with that of TGFBR2 in clinical samples. We also discovered 
      that TGF-beta dramatically increased the expression of miR-520e, which targeted
      and downregulated TGFBR2, and the suppression of miR-520e significantly impaired 
      TGF-beta-induced TGFBR2 downregulation. ChIP-PCR experiments further showed that 
      miR-520e is transcriptionally induced by SMAD2/3 in response to TGF-beta. Our
      findings reveal a novel negative feedback mechanism in TGF-beta signaling and the
      expression level of miR-520e could be a predictive biomarker for NSCLC
      metastasis.

AB  - Aim of the study was to examine the effect of deslorelin on uterine tissues of
      eleven pre-pubertal bitches aged 4.2 +/- 0.6 m. Implants containing placebo
      (sodium chloride 0.9%; n = 4, G I), 4.7 mg (n = 3, GII) or 9.4 mg (n = 4, GIII)
      deslorelin acetate (Suprelorin((R)) ; Virbac, France), were administered
      subcutaneously. Signs of oestrus, vaginal cytology, serum progesterone (P4) and
      estradiol-17beta (E2) concentrations were monitored until the occurrence of
      oestrus. Bitches were ovariohysterectomized and sections from the uterine tissue 
      were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detection of GnRH receptor (R), 
      Kisspeptin (KP)10, Kisspeptin receptor (GPR54), androgen receptor (AR), oestrogen
      receptor (ER) alpha,beta, and progesterone receptor (PR). Tissue sections were
      scored semi-quantitatively using an immunoreactivity score (IRS) ranging from 0
      to 300 (3). Since some animals were ovariohysterectomized before puberty (n = 1
      from GII and n = 2 from GIII), and some in metestrus (all controls and 2 from GII
      and GIII each), results from these animals were separately evaluated and compared
      to the controls. Results: No abnormalities were seen in uterine tissues.
      Kisspeptin 10 expression was low in all cell types, highest IRS were seen in the 
      vascular endothelial cells. The GPR54 was mainly detected in the luminal
      epithelial cells, superficial and deep uterine glands. The expression of GPR54
      and ERalpha,beta was especially high in bitches operated prepubertally. No
      difference was observed between the controls and experimental bitches operated in
      their first metestrus. The PR and ERalpha,beta were exclusively expressed in
      superficial and deep uterine glands and luminal surface epithelial cells. The AR 
      and GnRH-R expression was negative in all cells of all groups. We conclude that
      application of 4.7 or 9.4 mg deslorelin at the age of 4 months did not cause
      uterine disturbances. GPR54 expression might be influenced by pre-pubertal
      deslorelin treatment or the changings related to approaching puberty; the latter 
      is supposed in case of ERalpha,beta.

TI  - Does Sericin, as a Novel Pleurodesis Agent, Have Higher Effectiveness Compared to
      Talcum Powder, Doxycycline, and Silver Nitrate Pleurodesis?
LID - S0300-2896(18)30360-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.arbres.2018.10.003 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The usefulness of sericin as pleurodesis agent has previously been 
      described. Present study aims to compare sericin pleurodesis regarding success,
      effectiveness, tolerability, and side-effects. METHODS: Adult, 12-week-old
      Wistar-albino rats (n=60), divided to five groups as sericin, talcum-powder,
      doxycycline, silver-nitrate and control. Agents were administrated through left
      thoracotomy, rats sacrificed twelve-days after. RESULTS: Highest ratio of
      collagen fibers was observed in sericin group, and the intensity was higher than 
      talcum-powder group (p<0.05). Compared to silver nitrate, sericin group displayed
      better mesothelial reaction, and multi-layer mesothelium was also better
      (p<0.05). Foreign body reaction and emphysema were less frequent in sericin group
      (p<0.05). The presence of biological tissue in parenchyma was less prominent in
      sericin group (p<0.05). Foreign body reaction on thoracic wall was less common in
      sericin group (p<0.05). Presence of biological tissue glue in thoracic wall was
      less prominent in sericin group (p<0.05). Glomerular degeneration was lower in
      sericin group compared to the silver nitrate group (p<0.05), and tubular
      degeneration was less common in sericin group than talcum group (p<0.05).
      Pericarditis was less common in sericin group compared to the other groups
      (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: As an intrinsic, natural glue protein, sericin protects the
      lung parenchyma and tissues, and its glue-like characteristics enable
      pleurodesis. The success of sericin in pleurodesis was demonstrated in the
      present study based on investigations of the pleurae. Being cost-effective and
      better tolerated agent associated with a low potential of side effects, sericin
      is more effective, less expensive and provides more lung parenchyma protection.

TI  - Phenotypic spectrum associated with SPECC1L pathogenic variants: new families and
      critical review of the nosology of Teebi, Opitz GBBB, and Baraitser-Winter
      syndromes.
LID - S1769-7212(18)30464-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejmg.2018.11.022 [doi]
AB  - The SPECC1L protein plays a role in adherens junctions involved in cell adhesion,
      actin cytoskeleton organization, microtubule stabilization, spindle organization 
      and cytokinesis. It modulates PI3K-AKT signaling and controls cranial neural
      crest cell delamination during facial morphogenesis. SPECC1L causative variants
      were first identified in individuals with oblique facial clefts. Recently,
      causative variants in SPECC1L were reported in a pedigree reported in 1988 as
      atypical Opitz GBBB syndrome. Six families with SPECC1L variants have been
      reported thus far. We report here eight further pedigrees with SPECC1L variants, 
      including a three-generation family, and a further individual of a previously
      published family. We discuss the nosology of Teebi and GBBB, and the syndromes
      related to SPECC1L variants. Although the phenotype of individuals with SPECC1L
      mutations shows overlap with Opitz syndrome in its craniofacial anomalies, the
      canonical laryngeal malformations and male genital anomalies are not observed.
      Instead, individuals with SPECCL1 variants have branchial fistulae, omphalocele, 
      diaphragmatic hernias, and uterus didelphis. We also point to the clinical
      overlap of SPECC1L syndrome with mild Baraitser-Winter craniofrontofacial
      syndrome: they share similar dysmorphic features (wide, short nose with a large
      tip, cleft lip and palate, blepharoptosis, retrognathia, and craniosynostosis),
      although intellectual disability, neuronal migration defect, and muscular
      problems remain largely specific to Baraitser-Winter syndrome. In conclusion, we 
      suggest that patients with pathogenic variants in SPECC1L should not be described
      as "dominant (or type 2) Opitz GBBB syndrome", and instead should be referred to 
      as "SPECC1L syndrome" as both disorders show distinctive, non overlapping
      developmental anomalies beyond facial communalities.

AB  - Dysfunction of motile monocilia, altering the leftward flow at the embryonic node
      essential for determination of left-right body asymmetry, is a major cause of
      laterality defects. Laterality defects are also often associated with reduced
      mucociliary clearance caused by defective multiple motile cilia of the airway and
      are responsible for destructive airway disease. Outer dynein arms (ODAs) are
      essential for ciliary beat generation, and human respiratory cilia contain
      different ODA heavy chains (HCs): the panaxonemally distributed gamma-HC DNAH5,
      proximally located beta-HC DNAH11 (defining ODA type 1), and the distally
      localized beta-HC DNAH9 (defining ODA type 2). Here we report loss-of-function
      mutations in DNAH9 in five independent families causing situs abnormalities
      associated with subtle respiratory ciliary dysfunction. Consistent with the
      observed subtle respiratory phenotype, high-speed video microscopy demonstrates
      distally impaired ciliary bending in DNAH9 mutant respiratory cilia.
      DNAH9-deficient cilia also lack other ODA components such as DNAH5, DNAI1, and
      DNAI2 from the distal axonemal compartment, demonstrating an essential role of
      DNAH9 for distal axonemal assembly of ODAs type 2. Yeast two-hybrid and
      co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicate interaction of DNAH9 with the ODA
      components DNAH5 and DNAI2 as well as the ODA-docking complex component CCDC114. 
      We further show that during ciliogenesis of respiratory cilia, first proximally
      located DNAH11 and then distally located DNAH9 is assembled in the axoneme. We
      propose that the beta-HC paralogs DNAH9 and DNAH11 achieved specific functional
      roles for the distinct axonemal compartments during evolution with human DNAH9
      function matching that of ancient beta-HCs such as that of the unicellular
      Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

AB  - Current study was designed to investigate the protective effects of royal jelly
      on Flunixin me- glumine (FM)-induced spermiotoxicity related to sperm
      concentration, abnormal spermatozoa count and histopathological changes in mice
      testis. The subjects were divided into five groups according to FM and/or royal
      jelly intake: Control group; group 1, FM alone (25 mg/kg, im); group 2,
      combination of FM (25 mg/kg, im) and royal jelly (200 mg/kg, oral); group 3, FM
      alone (50 mg/kg, im); and group 4, combination of FM (50 mg/kg, im) and royal
      jelly (200 mg/kg, oral). The animals were fed once daily for 15 days and they
      were sacrificed last day. Epididymal sperm concentration and abnormal spermatozoa
      count were noted. Testicular histological findings were evaluated. On purpose,
      organization of each animal was graded according to Johnsen's scoring to assess
      the spermatogenesis relying on seminiferous tubule cross-section scores.
      Comparing to controls, FM administration caused a decrease in sperm concentration
      (p0.05), an increase in total abnormal spermatozoa rates (p0.05) and more
      degenerative changes in testes in mice. Royal jelly supplementation ameliorated
      both sperm concentration and abnormal spermato- zoa (p0.05) comparing to the
      control group. In conclusion, we suggested that royal jelly might have protective
      effects in the FM-induced reductions in epididymal sperm concentration and in-
      crease in abnormal spermatozoa rate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of irreparable rotary cuff (RC) tears, the superior 
      capsule of the shoulder is reconstructed using tensor fascia lata (TFL) or
      several allografts to prevent progressive joint degeneration. This study compared
      the healing qualities of acellular human dermal graft (HDG) and the TFL autograft
      in superior capsule reconstruction (SCR) from biomechanical and histologic
      perspectives. METHODS: Chronic retracted RC tear models were created bilaterally 
      in 9 rabbits, and 7 rabbits with intact RC were used as a control group. SCR was 
      performed 8 weeks after the tear using HDG in right shoulders and TFL in left
      shoulders. At 12 weeks after SCR, 2 shoulders from each experimental group were
      investigated for histologic healing, and 7 samples from the experimental and
      control groups were biomechanically tested. RESULTS: Complete healing was
      observed macroscopically in the glenoid and humeral sides of both groups. No
      difference was observed in the enthesis maturation scores between the
      experimental groups. Collagen fiber density was higher and the orientation was
      better in TFL group. Inflammatory cell infiltration was not seen in the TFL
      group, but inflammatory cell infiltration was pronounced in the HDG group. The
      mean pullout strengths of the TFL group, HDG group, and intact RC group were
      139.7 +/- 40.5 N, 123.9 +/- 47.9 N, and 105.1 +/- 11.8 N (P = .187),
      respectively. The mean stiffness values (P = .711), yield forces (P = .404), and 
      displacements (P = .135) were also statistically not different between the
      groups. CONCLUSION: In SCR, the healing qualities of HDG and TFL were similar in 
      rabbit models.

AB  - Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major neonatal health problem that
      especially affects preterm infants and causes severe morbidity and mortality.
      Although its pathogenesis is not fully understood, important risk factors include
      prematurity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Ankaferd Blood
      Stopper(R) (ABS) has antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, antiapoptotic,
      and wound healing accelerant properties. In this study, we aimed to investigate
      whether treatment with ABS reduced the severity of NEC in rat pups in an
      experimental NEC model. Thirty-six newborn Wistar albino rat pups were randomly
      assigned to the control, NEC + saline, or NEC + ABS groups. NEC was induced by
      intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide, feeding with hyperosmolar
      enteral formula, and exposure to hypoxia/hyperoxia and cold stress. ABS was
      administered intraperitoneally to the pups in the NEC + ABS group daily starting 
      on day 1 of the study at a dose of 2 ml/kg by diluting 2 ml with saline at a
      ratio of 1:3. All pups were sacrificed on day 4. The terminal ileum including the
      proximal colon was removed for histopathological and immunohistochemical
      examination and biochemical analysis. Macroscopic assessment and intestinal
      injury scores were lower in NEC + ABS group compared to the NEC + saline group (p
      < 0.05). Immunohistochemical evaluations of caspase-3, -8, and -9 revealed
      significantly reduced apoptosis in the NEC + ABS group compared to the NEC +
      saline group (p = 0.001). Total oxidant status, oxidative stress index, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta levels, and lipid, protein, and
      deoxyribonucleic acid oxidation products were significantly lower in the NEC +
      ABS group compared to NEC + saline group (p < 0.001 for all), while total
      antioxidant status, glutathione, and superoxide dismutase levels were higher in
      the NEC + ABS group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.01, respectively). ABS treatment
      has the potential to effectively reduce the severity of intestinal damage in NEC 
      due to its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties.
      Therefore, NEC may be an alternative option for treatment.

AB  - An 81-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus presented with signs of orbital
      cellulitis and a gangrenous ulcer on the right palate. Biopsy analysis confirmed 
      a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. Surgical debridement of necrotic tissues
      and enucleation of the right eye were performed. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was
      isolated from the specimens. The patient remained stable under antibiotic therapy
      and underwent reconstructive surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this
      represents a rare case of orbital necrotizing fasciitis developing secondary to
      S. maltophilia infection. Orbital necrotizing fasciitis is rare; the early
      clinical features may be similar to those of cellulitis. To prevent devastating
      complications, the former condition must be kept in mind, particularly in
      immunocompromised patients.

LID - 10.5152/tud.2018.22556 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the antioxidant effects of
      selenium and coenzyme Q on renal damage in a partial unilateral ureteral
      obstruction (PUUO) in a rat model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 24
      Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups as Group 1 Control Group, Group
      2, PUUO Group, Group 3 PUUO + coenzyme Q group, Group 4 PUUO + selenium group.
      Paraoxonase (PON), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and total oxidant levels
      (TOS) were analyzed biochemically from tissue and blood samples. Tissue samples
      were examined histopathologically. RESULTS: The TAC in the tissues was found to
      be statistically significantly increased in Groups 3 and 4, compared to Group 2. 
      Tissue TOS was found to be significantly reduced in Groups 3 and 4, compared to
      Group 2. Serum PON levels were significantly increased in Group 3 and 4, compared
      to Group 1 and 2. Histopathological examination showed that interstitial
      inflammation and congestion were lesser in the coenzyme Q and selenium groups
      than in the PUUO group. A more significant decrease was found in the selenium
      group than in the coenzyme Q group. CONCLUSION: Our study results showed that
      coenzyme Q and selenium reduced the oxidation and the damage in tissue in PUUO in
      rats.

TI  - Screening of AIP Gene Variations in a Cohort of Turkish Patients with Young-Onset
      Sporadic Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenomas.
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2018.0133 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene mutations have
      long been associated with apparently sporadic pituitary adenomas (PAs) with a
      prevalence range of 0-12%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of
      germline AIP variations in a large cohort of apparently sporadic PAs diagnosed
      before the age of 40 years, who did not exhibit hypercalcemia and/or MEN1
      syndrome components during long-term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of
      97 patients, diagnosed with functional PAs </=40 years old, composed of
      somatotropinoma (n = 55), prolactinoma (n = 25), and corticotrophinoma (n = 17), 
      were recruited for this study. Fifty-one of these patients [somatotropinoma (n = 
      30), prolactinoma (n = 15), and corticotrophinoma (n = 11)] were previously
      reported as AIP mutation-negative by Sanger sequencing. The entire coding
      sequence of the AIP gene, along with exon/intron boundaries and the untranslated 
      regions of 41 newly recruited patients, were sequenced for germline variations.
      In addition, all patients were subjected to multiplex ligation-dependent probe
      amplification to detect copy number variations in the AIP gene. RESULTS: The AIP 
      c.911G>A: p.Arg304Gln (rs104894190) variant was detected in only two patients
      with functional PA: one with somatotropinoma [in 1/55 (1.8%)] and one with
      prolactinoma [in 1/25 (4%)]. None of the corticotrophinomas revealed AIP gene
      alterations. Thus, the overall prevalence of AIP variation was 2.1% in our
      cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Germline AIP gene variations among Turkish patients with
      apparently sporadic PAs are relatively rare among patients </=40 years old. None 
      of the patients in our cohort revealed any obviously pathogenic AIP variants.

TI  - The diagnostic value of parathyroid hormone washout in primary
      hyperparathyroidism patients with negative or equivocal 99 m Tc-MIBI results.
LID - 10.1002/dc.24065 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The accurate identification of hyper functioning
      parathyroid gland is needed for definitive surgical treatment in primary
      hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasonography and 99mTechnetium sestamibi scintigraphy are
      the two most used methods with varying sensitivities. This study aimed to assess 
      the value of parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay in preoperative ultrasound guided
      fine needle aspiration (FNA)-PTH washout fluid to verify the correct localisation
      of lesions with negative or inconclusive scintigraphy results. METHODS: We
      evaluated data of 28 lesions in 21 patients who underwent US-guided parathyroid
      fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with PTH washout, retrospectively. The PTH washout
      results and the reports of parathyroid surgery and imaging studies were reviewed.
      RESULTS: Of operated 28 lesions 23 had positive and 5 had negative washout
      results. The median FNA-PTH washout was 2315.5 pg/ ml (min-max: 12.3-6978 pg/
      ml). The calculated sensitivity of FNA-PTH washout was 85.7% and the specifity
      was 28.6%. The positive and negative predictive values were 78.3% and 40.0%,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: FNA-PTH can be used to establish the nature of the
      lesion, discriminate parathyroid gland from thyroid lesions or cervical lymph
      nodes, improving the surgical outcomes. It can be used to localise parathyroid
      lesions preoperatively when negative or discordant ultrasound and scintigraphy
      findings are obtained.

      cervix in pregnancy: A case report and review of the literature.
LID - 10.1002/dc.24106 [doi]
AB  - Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the uterine cervix is a rare
      aggressive tumor. The examination of a cervicovaginal smear from a 31-year-old
      patient diagnosed with LCNEC after a cervical polypectomy during the 32nd week of
      pregnancy was carried out. The observed atypical cells had large cytoplasm,
      increased nucleus: cytoplasm ratio with the nucleus containing coarse, dispersed 
      chromatin, and were arranged in a pseudorosette formation, which all confirmed
      the diagnosis. In addition, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) was determined in the
      histopathological examination of the subsequent hysterectomy material. Given the 
      rarity of this condition, we present and discuss the case herein.

LID - 10.1002/jcla.22722 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Today, invasive diagnostic tests are necessary for definite
      diagnosis of adult celiac disease (CD). However, in selected children patients,
      the need for invasive tests is ceased. In this study, we evaluated adult patients
      according to the ESPGHAN (European Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and
      Nutrition Society) criteria. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (aged 17-66) with
      symptoms of CD were included. Serum samples were tested for total IgA, tTG-IgA
      (antitissue transglutaminase), tTG-IgG, DGP-IgA (antideamidated gliadin peptide),
      DGP-IgG, and EMA (endomysial antibodies). HLA-DQ typing was studied with PCR-SSP 
      (sequence-specific primers) method. Biopsy samples were evaluated according to
      Marsh scoring. RESULTS: In CD patients, 71.4% (15/21) of the patients were
      diagnosed without biopsy according to the EPSGHAN criteria but when ESPGHAN's IgA
      tTG threshold value for children was taken into consideration (>200 IU/mL), the
      sensitivity decreased to 81%. Celiac disease diagnosed and control groups were
      compared in terms of HLA tissue types. DQ2.5 homozygous or DQ2.5/DQ2.2 was
      significantly higher in CD group, and DQ2- or DQ8-negative HLA tissue type was
      significantly higher in control group. CONCLUSION: When serological tests, HLA
      typing, and clinical symptoms are all in favor of CD, biopsy may not be performed
      in selected adult CD patients.

TI  - Is Ozone (O3) Treatment Effective in Atrophic Rhinitis? Experimental Animal
      Study.
PG  - 37-44
LID - 10.5604/01.3001.0012.1265 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atrophic rhinitis (AR) is a disease characterized by atrophy of the
      mucosa, submucosa, bone tissue due to an unknown cause and excessive nasal cavity
      enlargement. The disease still has no complete treatment, and the treatment of
      the functional loss of atrophic cells in AR is still a matter to be investigated.
      Ozone (O3) therapy has been shown to enhance cell metabolism, angiogenesis,
      fibroblast activity, and collagen synthesis. AIM: To determine whether ozone
      treatment affects the disease histopathologically, in experimentally created AR. 
      Material - Method: Twelve Wistar Hanover strain albino male rats were included in
      the study. Atrophic rhinitis was induced in animals by administering Pasteurella 
      multocida toxin diluted with saline for 21 days to both nasal cavities. A total
      of 12 animals included in the study were divided into 2 groups as control and
      study. Ozone gas (60 mug/mL) was administered rectally to the study group for 21 
      days. After 2 weeks, the rats were decapitated, the nasal cavities were removed
      as a block, and atrophic rhinitis parameters (epithelial hyperplasia, goblet cell
      loss, cilia loss, inflammatory infiltration, and vascular ectasia) were evaluated
      under light microscopy by histopathological examination and statistically
      interpreted. RESULT: The incidence of vascular ectasia was significantly lower in
      the ozone group compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). There was no
      significant difference between the groups regarding other histopathologic
      findings. CONCLUSION: Ozone treatment was moderate at the histopathological
      level. We concluded that ozone therapy has no or very limited effect on atrophic 
      rhinitis.

AB  - Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are aggressive, poorly differentiated
      tumors in children and young adults. However, the embryonal tumor group did not
      include the central nervous system (CNS) PNET title and ependymoblastoma subtitle
      in the 2016 World Health Organization CNS tumor classification. Here, we report
      the case of a 6-year-old boy with a sellar embryonal tumor and present a review

TI  - A case of entecavir-associated bullous fixed drug eruption and a review of
      literature.
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2018.17887 [doi]
AB  - Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is a type of drug reaction characterized by localized
      erythema, hyperpigmentation, and bullous at the same site(s), generally observed 
      following every intake of a causative drug. Delayed-type cellular
      hypersensitivity (Type IVC) is considered to play a role in FDE etiology. Several
      antibiotics, barbiturates, oral contraceptives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs, laxative-containing phenolphthalein, metronidazole, and quinine are known 
      to be the primary drugs responsible for FDE. Bullous FDE, on the other hand, is a
      relatively rare form of FDE. Hepatitis B is a significant worldwide health
      problem, and entecavir is a common nucleoside (deoxyguanosine) analog used for
      treating hepatitis B; however, it has various side effects, such as lactic
      acidosis, myalgia, azotemia, hypophosphatemia, headache, diarrhea, pancreatitis, 
      and neuropathy, and, in rare cases, cutaneous drug eruption. Our aim is to
      present a case of entecavir-associated bullous drug reaction, which has not been 
      reported in the literature. Furthermore, we performed a review of literature to
      compile previously reported entecavir-associated drug reactions.

TI  - Are there predictors that can determine neoadjuvant treatment responses in rectal
      cancer?
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2018.18179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to determine a predictive bioindicator that
      would detect the treatment response of patients diagnosed with rectal cancer and 
      treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      data collected from 37 patients receiving nCRT were retrospectively evaluated.
      The p53 score and gene instability in MLH1 and MSH2, which are among the DNA
      mismatch repair (MMR) genes, were evaluated using immunohistochemical methods.
      The neutrophils-leukocytes ratio (NLR), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and
      carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 values were obtained as hematological parameters
      from computer records. The pathologic analysis of the therapy response after nCRT
      was classified according to the modified grading system by Ryan et al. Results:
      The changes in the NLR, CEA, and CA19-9 values before and after treatment were
      statistically significant (p</=0.001 and p=0.005). A near significant effect of
      the decrease of the CEA value in the 5th week after treatment was detected on the
      pathological response score (p=0.075). The p53 mutation score in those patients
      with any residue was higher than the total response. Overall, 89.2% of the
      patients exhibited MMR positivity (stability), and 10.8% of the cases with MRM
      negativity (instability) had a macroscopic residue. Cases with pathological total
      response were MRM positive. CONCLUSION: Consequently, in most of the patients
      treated with nCRT, the treatment caused tumor and nodal remission. In the
      prediction of this therapy response, hematological and genetic parameters, such
      as NLR, P53, MLH1, and MSH2, play a predictive role.

PG  - 89
LID - 10.1186/s13000-018-0769-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Massive localized lymphedema (MLL) is a non-neoplastic benign soft
      tissue lesion that may be confused with sarcomas or other neoplastic
      proliferations both clinically and morphologically. Most occur in morbidly obese 
      adults on the lower extremities. The objective of this article is to document a
      case of MLL in the retroperitoneal cavity which is a previously unreported site
      for this lesion, and to highlight its unusual clinical features. CASE
      PRESENTATION: The patient was a non-obese male who had undergone major abdominal 
      surgery due to bladder extrophy 17 years ago. Abdominal ultrasonography detected 
      a large incidental mass in the right renal sinus during his investigation for
      nephrolithiasis. The lesion extending from renal pelvis down to pelvis was
      resected and its histopathological findings were compatible with massive
      localized lymphedema. CONCLUSIONS: Retroperitoneum has to be added to the list of
      locations that MLL can be found. Liposarcoma will be a challenging differential
      diagnosis when the lesion is encountered in an unusual site.

LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.003104 [doi]
AB  - Multilocus sequence analysis of Xanthomonas species revealed a very close
      relationship between Xanthomonas cynarae, an artichoke pathogen and Xanthomonas
      gardneri, a tomato and pepper pathogen. Results of whole genome sequence
      comparisons using average nucleotide identity between representative strains of
      X. gardneri and X. cynarae were well above the threshold of 95-96 %. Inoculations
      of X. gardneri strains in artichoke leaves caused mild disease symptoms, but only
      weak symptoms were observed in the bracts. Both X. cynarae and X. gardneri grew
      equally and caused typical bacterial spot symptoms in pepper after artificial
      inoculation. However, X. cynarae induced a hypersensitive reaction in tomato,
      while X. gardneri strains were virulent. Pathogenicity-associated gene clusters, 
      including the protein secretion systems, type III effector profiles, and
      lipopolysaccharide cluster were nearly identical between the two species. Based
      on our results from whole genome sequence comparison, X. gardneri and X. cynarae 
      belong to the same species. The name X. cynarae has priority and X. gardneri
      should be considered as a later heterotypic synonym. An emended description of X.
      cynarae (type strain=CFBP 4188(T), =DSM 16794(T)) is given. However, due to the
      host specificity in artichoke and tomato, two pathovars, X. cynarae pv. cynarae
      and X. cynarae pv. gardneri, are proposed.

      safety and performance outcomes EBUS-TBNA in elderly.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/13685538.2018.1538337 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Complication rates are low and endobronchial ultrasound guided needle
      aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is generally regarded as a safe procedure, but there is a 
      very limited number of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of the
      procedure in advanced ages. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and
      performance outcomes of EBUS-TBNA in elderly. METHODS: It was a retrospective
      observational study; patients who received EBUS-TBNA between September 2016 and
      January 2018 were evaluated. We analyzed patient's characteristics, doses of
      midazolam, and lidocaine used, regions of lymph node biopsies, and complications.
      Also, functionality and general physical status of patients over 65 years of age 
      were evaluated. RESULTS: During study period 132 cases of EBUS-TBNA were
      evaluated. 39 (29.5%) cases were aged 70 years, and over. There were more
      comorbidities in older group. Performance status of older group was worse.
      Furthermore, when evaluated according to American College of Cardiology
      (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and American Society of Anesthesiologists 
      (ASA), the older group was found to be composed of the riskier patients. When
      patients aged between 65 and 69, and over 70 compared, older patient's Barthel,
      EQ 5-D, SGA, and G8 scores were found to be worse. Despite that, there was no
      difference in the frequency, and types of complications between both groups.
      Diagnostic performance was not different between age groups. CONCLUSIONS:
      Independent from comorbidities, general health status, and functionality
      EBUS-TBNA procedure in 70-year-old and over patients is a safe minimally invasive
      procedure.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Perivascular epithelioid celltumor (PEComa) is a rare mesenchymal
      neoplasia and can be found in various body sites. On the other hand, hepatic
      PEComa is very rare, with only a few studies having reported hepatic malignant
      PEComa. There is no gold standard regarding the use of diagnostic imaging
      studies. The diagnosis of hepatic PEComa is made by a positive
      immunohistochemical staining for HMB45 and Melan A. Herein, we discussed the
      therapeutic and follow-up process of a symptomatic hepatic PEComa case.
      PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 22-year-old woman presented with a palpable mass in
      abdomen. A computerized tomographic examination showed a giant hepatic mass of
      left lobe origin, which was excised surgically. The pathology result was reported
      as a PEComa. DISCUSSION: The diagnostic approach, treatment modalities, and
      follow-up procedures are not standard. The main treatment modality for PEComa is 
      surgical excision with adequate surgical margin. CONCLUSION: A longer follow-up
      is required for patients with hepatic PEComa because the nature of the disease is
      not entirely clear.

AB  - There are a number of studies investigating anti-inflammatory effects of
      simvastatin in patients with sepsis and animal models. There are a few studies
      which investigated effect of simvastatin on elements in sepsis. In the present
      study, the impact of pretreatment with simvastatin on element levels was
      evaluated in liver during endotoxemia. Rats were divided into control, LPS,
      simvastatin, and simvastatin + LPS. The histopathologic examination of the liver 
      was performed using hematoxylin and eosin. Selenium, zinc, iron, manganese,
      magnesium, and copper were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma - optical
      emission spectroscopy. In the LPS, the hepatocyte cell structure was damaged. In 
      the simvastatin + LPS, hepatocyte, and sinusoidal cord damage were partially
      smaller than LPS. Levels of selenium, and copper significantly decreased in both 
      of LPS and simvastatin + LPS. In the LPS group, iron was found to increase. In
      the simvastatin + LPS, zinc was increased. Simvastatin partially smaller liver
      damage by increasing zinc levels during endotoxemia.

TI  - Neuroprotective Effects of Hesperidin on Cerebral Vasospasm Following
      Experimental Subarachnoid Haemorrhage in Rats: Biochemical, Pathological and
      Histomorphometric Analysis.

AB  - We examined the protective effects of hesperidin on cerebral vasospasm by
      establishing an experimental rat model of subarachnoid haemorrhage and performing
      biochemical, pathological and histomorphometric analysis on these data. Forty
      albino Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups of n = 8 in each: Group
      (G)1, no experimental interventions; G2, subjected to subarachnoid haemorrhage;
      G3, subjected to subarachnoid haemorrhage and administered saline (100 mg/kg);
      G4, subjected to subarachnoid haemorrhage and treated with low dose hesperidin
      (50 mg/kg); G5, subjected to subarachnoid haemorrhage and treated with high dose 
      hesperidin (100 mg/kg). Subarachnoid haemorrhage was created by injecting 0.15 cc
      of autologous blood taken from the rat-tail artery and injected into the cisterna
      magna from the craniocervical junction. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally
      as twice daily doses for 48 h. Rats were sacrificed at the end of this period. No
      statistically significant decrease was observed in malondialdehyde levels, which 
      is the end-product of lipid peroxidation, among the drug groups (G4 and G5). Thin
      sections prepared from the basilar artery were examined morphologically. Severe
      luminal narrowing and vessel-wall thickening were observed in the
      subarachnoid-haemorrhage groups (G2, G3). In the hesperidin-administered groups
      (G4, G5), it was determined that vessel-wall-thickness measurements revealed
      thinner walls than in the subarachnoid-haemorrhage groups (G2, G3) and the
      luminal diameters were significantly larger than in the subarachnoid-haemorrhage 
      groups (G2, G3). These findings suggest that hesperidin has no effect on
      malondialdehyde-associated lipid-peroxidation activity; however, it might be
      useful in subarachnoid-haemorrhage therapy because of its beneficial effects on
      vessel-wall thickness and luminal diameters.

AB  - Activating mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase
      (TERT) gene are the most common genetic alterations in urothelial carcinoma (UC) 
      of the bladder and upper urinary tract. While the cadherin 1 (CDH1) gene is
      commonly mutated in the clinically aggressive plasmacytoid variant of urothelial 
      carcinoma (PUC), little is known about their TERT promoter mutation status. A
      retrospective search of our archives for PUC and UC with plasmacytoid and/or
      signet ring cell features (2007-2014) was performed. Ten specimens from 10
      patients had archived material available for DNA analysis and were included in
      the study. Intratumoral areas of non-plasmacytoid histology were also evaluated
      when present. Samples were analyzed for TERT promoter mutations with Safe-SeqS, a
      sequencing error-reduction technology, and sequenced using a targeted panel of
      the 10 most commonly mutated genes in bladder cancer on the Illumina MiSeq
      platform. TERT promoter mutations were detected in specimens with pure and focal 
      plasmacytoid features (6 of 10). Similar to conventional UC, the predominant
      mutation identified was g.1295228C>T. In heterogeneous tumors with focal variant 
      histology, concordant mutations were found in plasmacytoid and corresponding
      conventional, glandular, or sarcomatoid areas. Co-occurring mutations in tumor
      protein p53 (TP53, 2 cases) and kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) viral proto-oncogene
      (1 case) were also detected. TERT promoter mutations are frequently present in
      PUC, which provides further evidence that TERT promoter mutations are common
      events in bladder cancer, regardless of histologic subtype, and supports their
      inclusion in any liquid biopsy assay for bladder cancer.

TI  - Management of Cytological Material, Pre-Analytical Procedures and Bio-Banking in 
      Effusion Cytopathology.
LID - 10.1111/cyt.12654 [doi]
AB  - Serous effusion fluid is one of the most commonly encountered specimens in
      routine cytopathology practice. It provides invaluable information about the
      patient and the clinical status; but to get the most of it, specimen handling and
      processing must be carried out properly. Cytomorphology is the basis of a
      successful analysis which should complemented by ancillary tests when needed. A
      wide spectrum of ancillary techniques - ranging from immunocytochemistry and flow
      cytometry to different assays of molecular pathology - can be applied to serous
      effusions. This article describes the acquisition and management of serous
      effusion fluids, methods for preservation and transportation, different
      techniques of cytopreparation, application of immunocytochemistry, flow
      cytometry, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), as well as DNA
      extraction for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next generation sequencing
      (NGS). Principles of bio-banking of effusion samples are also discussed which is 
      getting more important in correlation with the developments in personalized
      medicine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Gastroprotective effects of oleuropein and thymol on indomethacin-induced gastric
      ulcer in Sprague-Dawley rats.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/01480545.2018.1530261 [doi]
AB  - Ethnopharmacological studies demonstrated that thymol (Thym) and oleuropein (Ole)
      have therapeutic potential for gastric ulcers. The molecular mechanism underlying
      the gastroprotective effects of these compounds have not been elucidated yet
      especially for their individual and combination use at high dose. Therefore, this
      study was conducted to explore their gastroprotective mechanisms on indomethacin 
      (Indo)-induced gastric ulcer model. Ole (50,100, 250, and 500 mg/kg) and Thym
      (50,100, 200, and 500 mg/kg) were orally administered to the rats 10 min before
      the induction of ulcer with Indo. The combination of 500 mg/kg doses of Ole and
      Thym were applied. The gastric mucosa was evaluated histopathologically.
      Moreover, TAC/TOS, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), prostaglandin E2
      (PGE2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and caspase-3 levels were
      assessed by ELISA and the caspase-3 and TNF-alpha expressions were quantified by 
      qRT-PCR. Indo-induced histopathological changes while Ole and Thym pretreatment
      prevented these effects. Unlike the 500 mg/kg dose of Ole treatment, the 500
      mg/kg dose of Thym administration enhanced these damages. The decreased TAC, PGE2
      levels and increased TOS, eNOS, TNF-alpha, caspase-3 levels were obtained in Indo
      group. However, these changes were reversed by Ole and Thym groups except the 500
      mg/kg dose of Thym and the combination treatment groups. Similar trends were
      observed in the caspase-3 and TNF-alpha expression levels. These results
      demonstrated that enhanced inflammation, oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, and
      apoptotic activities were occurred in Indo, 500 mg/kg dose of Thym and the
      combination treatment groups while not in the other groups. The findings
      demonstrated the gastroprotective ability of Ole and low doses of Thym in gastric
      ulcer models.

      Report and Systematic Review.
PG  - 225-233
LID - 10.5146/tjpath.2018.01429 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors of
      recurrence in uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex-cord tumors (UTROSCT) and to 
      determine clinical-pathological characteristics, treatment options and outcome.
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: An electronic literature search was conducted from 1976 to
      2018. After the comprehensive evaluation and conjunction with our case, the study
      included 79 cases. RESULTS: The median age at initial diagnosis was 49 years
      (range; 16-86 years). The age was under 40 years in 21 (26.6%) patients. Whereas 
      68 patients underwent at least hysterectomy, 9 patients had organ sparing
      surgery. There was necrosis in 4 (5.1%) patients, atypia in 16 (20.3%) patients, 
      and infiltrative tumor border in 34 (43%) patients. At least one mitosis per 10
      high power fields was determined in 36 (45.5%) patients. The tumor involved at
      least part of the myometrium in 54 (68.3%) patients. Median follow-up time was 30
      months (range; 3-296 months). Recurrence was determined in 5 (6.3%) patients. The
      disease free survival (DFS) was significantly related only to surgery type. None 
      of the pathologic features were associated with DFS. The 5-year DFS was 86% and
      96% in patients who underwent organ sparing surgery or not, respectively
      (p=0.038). CONCLUSION: The accurate pathologic diagnosis of UTROSCT has great
      value in shaping surgical management and management during the follow-up period. 
      Organ sparing surgery was related to poor DFS. Although recurrence is rare, it
      should be kept in mind for patients with UTROSCT.

TI  - Intraoperative palpation of sentinel lymph nodes can accurately predict axilla in
      early breast cancer.
LID - 10.1111/tbj.13149 [doi]
AB  - Recent randomized trials have shown that completion axillary lymph node
      dissection (ALND) is not required in all patients with a positive sentinel lymph 
      node (SLN) who will receive radiation therapy. Although routine intraoperative
      pathologic assessment (IPA) becomes unnecessary and less indicated by breast
      surgeons in the United States and some European countries, it is still widely
      used all around the world. In this prospective study, the feasibility of
      intraoperative nodal palpation (INP) as opposed to IPA of the SLN has been
      analyzed. Between March 2014 and June 2015, 305 patients with clinical T1-2/N0
      breast cancer from two different breast clinics (cohort A; [n = 225] and cohort
      B; [n = 80]) who underwent any breast surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy
      (SLNB) were included in this study. Surgeons evaluated the SLNs by manual
      palpation before sending for IPA, and findings compared with the final pathology.
      The positive predictive values (PPV) of INP and IPA were 81.8% and 97.9%,
      respectively, whereas the negative predictive values (NPV) of INP and IPA were
      83% and 92.4%. The accuracies of INP and IPA were 82.6% and 94.1%, respectively. 
      If patients with SLNB including micrometastasis were also considered in the final
      pathologic assessment (FPA) (-) group that would not require a further axillary
      dissection, the revised NPV of INP and FPA were found to be 92.6% and 98.1%,
      respectively. The revised accuracy of INP also found to be increase to 86.9%. Our
      study, which is the only prospective one about palpation of dissected SLNs in the
      literature, suggests that INP can help to identify patients who do not need ALND,
      which encourages omitting IPA in cT1-2 N0 breast cancer.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of borax (BX) against
      heavy metal exposure on the transcriptional and biochemical reaction in vivo and 
      alleviating effect on gill and liver tissues of rainbow trout. Due to this aim,
      fish were fed with different level of BX and/or copper (Cu) (1.25, 2.5 and 5mg/kg
      of BX; 500 and 1000mg/kg of Cu) for 21.days in pre- and co-treatment options. The
      transcriptional parameters [(heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70), and cytochromes P450 
      (cyp1a), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase
      (CAT))], antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT and GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA),
      oxidative DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and caspase-3 levels
      were investigated in different tissues samples of treated and control fish. Our
      results revealed that antioxidant enzyme activity was increased and levels of
      8-OHdG, Caspase-3 and MDA were decreased in the BX and BX combined groups as
      compared to the copper combination group and to copper-only application during
      pre- and co-treatment (p<0.05). Similarly, hsp70 and cyp1a gene expressions were 
      decreased after treatment with BX. As conclusion, we suggest that borax itself is
      not an antioxidant it supportes antioxidant defense mechanism of fish disrupted
      by heavy metals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression may have role on
      recurrence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with positive surgical margin(s).
      OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the role of genetic expression changes of
      EGFR on recurrence rates in patients in follow up with surgically excised BCC
      with positive surgical margin(s). METHODS: Thirty-four surgical margin-positive
      BCC lesions that were closely followed up without an immediate reoperation were
      included in this study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed
      from the both healthy and tumoral tissue samples. RESULTS: EGFR was expressed at 
      a significantly higher rate in tumoral tissues compared to healthy tissues
      (p<0,05). In patients with recurrence lesions, EGFR expression was 6,66 times
      higher compared to patients with non-recurrent. Also, there was statistically
      significant difference EGFR expression for infiltrative subtypes (p<0,05).
      CONCLUSION: Our study focuses on the role of EGFR overexpression specifically and
      outcomes for recurrent and infiltrative subtyped lesions are significant for both
      clinic and pathogenesis of BCC. Similar studies have to be performed with high
      numbered patient groups.

TI  - Is there long-term value of pathology scoring in immunoglobulin A nephropathy? A 
      validation study of the Oxford Classification for IgA Nephropathy (VALIGA)
      update.
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfy302 [doi]
AB  - Background: It is unknown whether renal pathology lesions in immunoglobulin A
      nephropathy (IgAN) correlate with renal outcomes over decades of follow-up.
      Methods: In 1130 patients of the original Validation Study of the Oxford
      Classification for IgA Nephropathy (VALIGA) cohort, we studied the relationship
      between the MEST score (mesangial hypercellularity, M; endocapillary
      hypercellularity, E; segmental glomerulosclerosis, S; tubular
      atrophy/interstitial fibrosis, T), crescents (C) and other histological lesions
      with both a combined renal endpoint [50% estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR) loss or kidney failure] and the rate of eGFR decline over a follow-up
      period extending to 35 years [median 7 years (interquartile range 4.1-10.8)].
      Results: In this extended analysis, M1, S1 and T1-T2 lesions as well as the whole
      MEST score were independently related with the combined endpoint (P < 0.01), and 
      there was no effect modification by age for these associations, suggesting that
      they may be valid in children and in adults as well. Only T lesions were
      associated with the rate of eGFR loss in the whole cohort, whereas C showed this 
      association only in patients not treated with immunosuppression. In separate
      prognostic analyses, the whole set of pathology lesions provided a gain in
      discrimination power over the clinical variables alone, which was similar at 5
      years (+2.0%) and for the whole follow-up (+1.8%). A similar benefit was observed
      for risk reclassification analyses (+2.7% and +2.4%). Conclusion: Long-term
      follow-up analyses of the VALIGA cohort showed that the independent relationship 
      between kidney biopsy findings and the risk of progression towards kidney failure
      in IgAN remains unchanged across all age groups and decades after the renal
      biopsy.

LID - 10.1016/j.jaip.2018.09.024 [doi]
AB  - Mastocytosis is a unique hematologic neoplasm with complex biology and pathology 
      and a variable clinical course. The disease can essentially be divided into
      cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and systemic mastocytosis (SM). In adults, SM is
      diagnosed in most cases and manifests as either indolent or advanced disease.
      Patients with advanced SM have an unfavorable prognosis with reduced survival.
      However, so far, little is known about the prevalence of various categories of SM
      and about prognostic factors. In an attempt to learn more about the behavior and 
      evolution of various forms of CM and SM, the European Competence Network on
      Mastocytosis (ECNM) initiated a mastocytosis registry in 2012. In this article,
      the set up and start phase of this registry are described. Until 2018, more than 
      3000 patients from 12 countries and 25 centers have been enrolled. In a majority 
      of all patients, robust follow-up data and relevant clinical end points are
      available. Using this data set, a series of registry projects have been launched,
      with the aim to validate previously identified diagnostic and prognostic
      variables and to identify new disease-related and patient-related parameters in
      various forms of mastocytosis. Moreover, the core data set of the registry will
      be useful to establish multiparametric scoring systems through which
      prognostication and individualized management of patients with mastocytosis
      should improve in the foreseeable future.

TI  - Locally Used Antibiotics for Spinal Infection Prophylaxis and Their Effects on
      Epidural Fibrosis: an Experimental Laminectomy Study in Rats Using Rifamycin and 
      Gentamycin.
LID - 10.1007/s10753-018-0929-x [doi]
AB  - The study aims to assess the effects of antibiotics (ABs), which are typically
      used in spinal infection prophylaxis, on the formation of epidural fibrosis (EF).
      Specifically, we investigated the effect of rifamycin and gentamycin on EF
      formation in laminectomized rats. Thirty-two rats were randomly and equally
      divided into four groups as follows: laminectomy and physiological saline (0.9%
      NaCl) solution (control); laminectomy and rifamycin; laminectomy and gentamicin; 
      and laminectomy and a mixture of rifamycin and gentamicin. Laminectomy was
      performed on L1 and L2 vertebrae in all rats. One month after spinal surgery,
      spinal tissue samples surrounding the laminectomy were cut with a microtome and
      stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome. The histopathological
      analysis included examining the extent of EF, fibroblast cell density, and
      cartilage and bone regeneration. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM
      SPSS Statistics 22 program (SPSS IBM, Turkey). A value of p < 0.05 was considered
      statistically significant. EF value differences between the AB treatment groups
      and the control group were statistically significant (p = 0.030). Specifically,
      binary comparisons indicated that the EF value was significantly higher in the
      rifamycin group than that in the control group (p = 0.003; p < 0.05). Our study
      suggests that locally applied ABs, especially rifamycin, should be diluted before
      administration to the epidural space.

TI  - Multiparametric MRI Features and Pathologic Outcome of Wedge-Shaped Lesions in
      the Peripheral Zone on T2-Weighted Images of the Prostate.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.2214/AJR.18.19742 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)
      characteristics and pathologic outcome of wedge-shaped lesions observed on
      T2-weighted images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with
      histologically confirmed prostate cancer underwent preoperative 3-T MRI before
      undergoing radical prostatectomy. Two radiologists worked in consensus to mark
      wedge-shaped regions of hypointensity on T2-weighted images and assess their
      appearance on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (to determine the degree 
      of hypointensity) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI (DCE-MRI) (to assess
      whether they showed early enhancement). The pathologic outcome of wedge-shaped
      lesions was assessed by matching MR images with whole-mount histologic specimens 
      retrospectively. The difference in quantitative ADC values between malignant and 
      benign wedge-shaped lesions was assessed using a t test. RESULTS: Thirty-five
      wedge-shaped regions were identified, 12 (34%) of which were found be malignant. 
      Most malignant wedge-shaped regions were highly hypointense (10/12; 83%) on ADC
      maps and showed early enhancement on DCE-MRI (7/12; 58%). However, benign
      wedge-shaped lesions were predominantly mildly hypointense (13/23; 57%) on ADC
      maps and showed no early enhancement (15/23; 65%). Histologic correlates of the
      benign wedge-shaped regions showed prostatitis (acute inflammation [7/23; 30%] or
      chronic inflammation [9/23; 39%]), hemosiderin-laden macrophages (6/23; 26%),
      prominent blood vessels (7/23; 30%), intraluminal blood (6/23; 26%), and
      nonspecific atrophy (6/23; 26%). The mean (+/- SD) quantitative ADC value of
      malignant wedge-shaped regions (1.13 +/- 0.11 mum(2)/ms) was significantly lower 
      (p = 0.0001) than that of benign wedge-shaped regions (1.52 +/- 0.27 mum(2)/ms). 
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that a greater percentage of wedge-shaped features
      are malignant than was previously thought. Of importance, mpMRI (specifically,
      ADC maps) can distinguish between malignant and benign wedge-shaped features.

LID - S1878-8750(18)32494-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wneu.2018.10.187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidural fibrosis is a major problem after spine surgery, with some
      patients having recurrent symptoms secondary to excessive formation of scar
      tissue resulting in neurologic compression. We used a rat laminectomy model to
      determine if topical application of boric acid could be helpful in the prevention
      of epidural fibrosis. METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to 2 control and 2
      experimental groups (n = 8 for each group). The negative control group received
      no surgery, and the positive control group underwent laminectomy only.
      Experimental groups were classified according to the study agents applied onto
      the dura mater after laminectomy at the L3 level: 2.5% boric acid solution and 5%
      boric acid solution. The extent of epidural fibrosis was assessed 4 weeks later
      macroscopically and histopathologically. RESULTS: Boric acid reduced epidural
      fibrosis in rats after laminectomy. The effect of 5% boric acid solution was more
      pronounced (P < 0.05) compared with the 2.5% solution. CONCLUSIONS: The
      antifibrotic effect of boric acid solution for the prevention of epidural
      fibrosis suggests that boric acid should be further evaluated in future studies
      for the prevention of epidural fibrosis.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Thymus praecox subsp. skorpilii var. skorpilii
      (syn. Thymus praecox subsp. jankae (Celak.) Jalas) is consumed as a Turkish folk 
      medicine for the treatment of spasm, sore throat and shortness of breath, also
      having strong antioxidant activity and the leaves of the plant have been utilized
      for the treatment of diabetes as the decoction in Turkey. AIM OF THE STUDY: In
      the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of
      antidiabetic action of Thymus praecox subsp. skorpilii var. skorpilii methanolic 
      extract (TPSE) on streptozotocin (STZ)/nicotinamide (NA)-induced type 2 diabetic 
      rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four 
      groups; control, diabetes, TPSE (100mg/kg b.w, p.o.) and metformin group
      (400mg/kg b.w, p.o.). Diabetes was established in all groups except control group
      by 55mg/kg STZ (i.p.) for once 15min after 100mg/kg NA injection. 3 days after
      STZ/NA injection, treatments were administered for three weeks and then rats were
      decapitated; tissue and blood samples were obtained for measuring the level of
      glucose transporters (both GLUTs and sodium glucose co-transporters (SGLTs)),
      enzymes related to glucose (Hexokinase (HK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
      (PEPCK), alpha-glucosidase) and lipid metabolism (Acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase
      (ACC)), AST, ALT, creatinine, insulin, anti-inflammatory (IL-10) and inflammatory
      (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) cytokines, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and glucagon like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1). Histopathological alterations of the pancreas were examined.
      RESULTS: After three weeks of treatment, TPSE has exhibited a significant
      reduction of plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokines. Besides, TPSE
      treatment elevated plasma insulin levels and normalized blood glucose levels.
      Moreover, it improved the values of AMPK in liver and GLP-1 in pancreas.
      Increased alpha-glucosidase, PEPCK, GLUT-2 and SGLTs levels with the induction of
      diabetes considerably lowered with TPSE treatment. Especially on SGLT-2, TPSE
      achieved a more prominent decrease. After the atrophy in Langerhans islets due to
      diabetes induction, treatment was found to prevent the damage of islets.
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings presented here, it has been concluded that
      TPSE has marked antidiabetic effects through various pathways on STZ/NA-induced
      diabetic rats and it may potentially be used as an effective treatment for type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Further research on isolation of the bioactive
      components is underway.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The reasons behind the removal of the biopsy tract in 
      osteosarcomas are not well known, and studies about tumor seeding in the biopsy
      tract have generated conflicting results. This study is designed to evaluate the 
      presence and possible clinical significance of tumor cell seeding in the biopsy
      tract of osteosarcomas. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 55 cases of
      osteosarcomas for tumor cell seeding and other clinical and pathologic prognostic
      parameters. RESULTS: Eleven cases (20%) involved microscopic tumor foci in the
      biopsy tract. The higher local recurrence rates (P = 0.005) and worse
      recurrence-free survivals ( P = 0.009) were observed in patients with tumor cell 
      foci in the biopsy tract. Mitotic rate, tumor cell pleomorphism, and matrix
      production in main tumor foci were higher in cases with tumor seeding ( P =
      0.047, P = 0.012, and P = 0.005, respectively) CONCLUSIONS: Tumor seeding in the 
      biopsy tract is a fact in osteosarcomas. The higher local recurrence rates are
      more likely to occur in cases with tumor seeding.

TI  - Proteomic approach for understanding milder neurotoxicity of Carfilzomib against 
      Bortezomib.
PG  - 16318
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-34507-3 [doi]
AB  - The proteasomal system is responsible for the turnover of damaged proteins.
      Because of its important functions in oncogenesis, inhibiting the proteasomal
      system is a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Bortezomib (BTZ)
      is the first proteasome inhibitor approved by FDA for clinical applications.
      However neuropathic side effects are dose limiting for BTZ as many other
      chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore second-generation proteasome inhibitors have
      been developed including carfilzomib (CFZ). Aim of the present work was
      investigating the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy triggered by the proteasome
      inhibitor BTZ and comparing the pathways affected by BTZ and CFZ, respectively.
      Neural stem cells, isolated from the cortex of E14 mouse embryos, were treated
      with BTZ and CFZ and mass spectrometry was used to compare the global protein
      pool of treated cells. BTZ was shown to cause more severe cytoskeletal damage,
      which is crucial in neural cell integrity. Excessive protein carbonylation and
      actin filament destabilization were also detected following BTZ treatment that
      was lower following CFZ treatment. Our data on cytoskeletal proteins, chaperone
      system, and protein oxidation may explain the milder neurotoxic effects of CFZ in
      clinical applications.

AB  - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided pancreatic cyst ablation with alcohol lavage
      or paclitaxel-based regimens are investigative modalities. To evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of EUS-guided pancreatic cyst ablation with alcohol lavage or
      paclitaxel-based regimens. A systematic review of computerized bibliographic
      databases was carried out for studies of EUS-guided pancreatic cyst ablation with
      alcohol lavage or paclitaxel-based regimens from January 1980 to February 2018.
      EUS-guided cyst ablation-related outcomes (cyst resolution) and complications.
      Data were extracted from six studies (N=207 patients) for EUS-guided cyst
      ablation with alcohol lavage and eight studies (N=347 patients) for EUS-guided
      cyst ablation with paclitaxel-based regimens. The pooled proportion of patients
      with complete cyst resolution was 68/207 (32.8%) for EUS-guided cyst ablation
      with alcohol lavage and 221/347 (63.6%) for EUS-guided cyst ablation with
      paclitaxel. Postablation adverse events with EUS-guided ablation with alcohol
      lavage were 44/207 (21.7%), and those with EUS-guided ablation with
      paclitaxel-based regimens were 52/347 (15%). Limitations of this study are
      because of the variability in study design and regimens tested, paucity of
      randomized trials, and differences in pancreatic cyst types receiving treatment. 
      EUS-guided cyst ablation appears to be effective and safe. The effect on
      pancreatic cancer incidence is unknown; EUS-guided pancreatic cyst ablation
      modalities require further improvement and validation to determine their role in 
      the treatment of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.

TI  - Comparative effects of methylprednisolone and tetracosactide (ACTH1-24) on
      ischemia/reperfusion injury of the rabbit spinal cord.
PG  - 1459-1470
LID - 10.5114/aoms.2017.65650 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Tetracosactide is an engineered peptide that applies the same
      biological impacts as the endogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone. Previous
      studies indicated that tetracosactide has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
      neurotrophic activity. In this study, we hypothesized that tetracosactide may
      have protective effects in spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury. Material and 
      methods: Rabbits were randomized into the accompanying four groups of eight
      animals each: group 1 (control), group 2 (ischemia), group 3 (methylprednisolone)
      and group 4 (tetracosactide). In the control group, just a laparotomy was
      performed. In the various groups, the spinal cord ischemia model was made by the 
      impediment of the aorta only caudal to the renal vein. Neurological assessment
      was conducted with the Tarlov scoring system. Levels of myeloperoxidase,
      malondialdehyde and catalase were analyzed, similar to the activities of xanthine
      oxidase and caspase-3. Histopathological and ultrastructural assessments were
      additionally performed. Results: After ischemia-reperfusion injury, increments
      were found in the tissue myeloperoxidase levels (p < 0.001), malondialdehyde
      levels (p < 0.001), xanthine oxidase action (p < 0.001) and caspase-3 movement (p
      < 0.001). Conversely, both serum and tissue catalase levels were diminished (p < 
      0.001 for both). After the administration of tetracosactide, declines were seen
      in the tissue myeloperoxidase levels (p < 0.001), malondialdehyde levels (p =
      0.003), xanthine oxidase action (p < 0.001) and caspase-3 movement (p < 0.001).
      Conversely, both the serum and tissue catalase levels were expanded (p < 0.001). 
      Besides, tetracosactide treatment indicated enhanced results related to the
      histopathological scores (p < 0.001), the ultra-structural score (p = 0.008) and 
      the Tarlov scores (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The findings showed for the first
      time that tetracosactide shows significant neuroprotective activity against
      ischemia-reperfusion injury of the spinal cord.

TI  - Histopathology of giant cell tumors of the bone: With special emphasis on
      fibrohistiocytic and aneurysmal bone cyst like components.

LID - 10.1016/j.aott.2018.10.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to define histopathological features of
      giant cell tumor of bone, especially accompanying fibrohistiocytic or aneurysmal 
      bone cyst like components, in the light of our institutions experience. METHODS: 
      A total of 120 cases (64 females and 56 males; mean age: 36.2 (12-80)) with 'GCT'
      diagnosed between the years 1996-2016 were included in this retrospective
      analysis. Cases were evaluated according to clinical features such as age,
      gender, localization, recurrence, metastasis and histopathological features.
      RESULTS: Tumors were localized most frequently at proximal tibia and distal
      femur, respectively. In 11 cases areas rich in fibrohistiocytic component and in 
      20 cases aneurysmal bone cyst like component were observed. In 2 cases both
      components were present. Twenty three cases recurred. In 1 case which was
      primarily located at calcaneus, tumor metastasized to lung 4 years later during
      follow-up. CONCLUSION: GCT can be confused with other tumor or tumor-like lesions
      involving giant cells. Secondary changes such as fibrohistiocytic or aneurysmal
      bone cyst-like components and coagulation necrosis were frequently seen in
      conventional giant cell tumor of bone. For tumors having prominent
      fibrohistiocytic and/or aneurysmal bone cyst-like components, in order to detect 
      characteristic areas representing GCT, additional sampling is essential. Although
      secondary histopathological changes do not appear to affect clinical outcome,
      these features are important in differential diagnosis. Approximately one fifth
      of GCT cases show recurrence and sacrum and foot bones were the most frequent
      sites for recurrence. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, diagnostic study.

TI  - GATA3 immunoreactivity expands the transcription factor profile of pituitary
      neuroendocrine tumors.
LID - 10.1038/s41379-018-0167-7 [doi]
AB  - The modern classification of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors relies mainly on
      immunohistochemistry for pituitary transcription factors, hormones, and other
      biomarkers, including low molecular weight cytokeratins. The transcription factor
      GATA2 is required for development of gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs but has not
      been used for classification of pituitary tumors. Because of genomic paralogy of 
      GATA2 and GATA3, we postulated that GATA3 immunohistochemistry may detect GATA2
      in the adenohypophysis. We examined 151 tumors originating from Ondokuz Mayis
      University, Turkey (n = 83) and University Health Network, Canada (n = 68).
      Initially, 83 tumors (26 gonadotroph, 24 somatotroph, 17 corticotroph, 12
      lactotroph, 2 poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumors that expressed TSH and 2
      null cell tumors) from Ondokuz Mayis University were investigated with the GATA3 
      monoclonal antibody L50-823. Retrospective review of the files of University
      Health Network identified 68 tumors (43 gonadotroph, 3 somatotroph, 2 lactotroph,
      1 mammosomatotroph, 9 corticotroph, 7 poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumors 
      with TSH expression, 2 plurihormonal tumors with TSH expression and 1 null cell
      tumor) that were examined with the same GATA3 antibody and served as a validation
      cohort. All somatotroph, lactotroph and mammosomatotroph tumors and the null cell
      tumors were negative for GATA3. Sixty-eight (98.5%) gonadotroph tumors were
      positive for GATA3; 64 had diffuse reactivity. Two plurihormonal tumors with TSH 
      expression and eight (88.8%) poorly differentiated Pit-1 lineage tumors with
      variable TSH expression were positive for GATA3. One of 26 (3.8%) corticotroph
      tumors was diffusely positive for GATA3. This study shows that GATA3
      immunoreactivity is characteristic of pituitary gonadotroph and TSH-producing
      tumors. This finding expands the pattern of transcription factors that are used
      to classify adenohypophysial tumors and is important in the differential
      diagnosis of sellar tumors, as GATA3 expression is also a feature of primary
      sellar paragangliomas as well as carcinomas that may metastasize to the sella.

AB  - Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a zoonotic and opportunistic pathogen, can cause latent
      infection, especially in lagomorphs. Nowadays, this member of the Eukaryotes has 
      drawn significant attention in the fields of veterinary and public health. The
      purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of infection in a New
      Zealand rabbit farm that has a clinical history of neurological manifestations
      including head tilt ataxia, aggressiveness, seizures, and circling and rotational
      movements around the body length axis, but the general conditions and food intake
      were normal. Blood samples were taken from 42 breeding rabbits and researched for
      E. cuniculi antibodies. Out of that, 25 (59%) animals resulted positive against
      the pathogen. The rabbit was found to be seropositive for E. cuniculi antibodies,
      but negative for Toxoplasma gondii and Listeria monocytogenes antibodies.
      Hematological and serum biochemical parameters were measured at reference
      intervals. No brain tissue impairment was observed the computed tomography (CT)
      scan. As a result of these histopathological findings, the brain cortex presented
      severe neuronal degeneration and partial myelin loss, with reactive diffuse
      gliosis against the parasite spores was observed to the histopathology. These
      results are possibly related to the early stage of infection because the
      parasitic infestation comprise long time spreading. E. cuniculi DNA was detected 
      on brain tissues using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and it partial DNA
      sequence was identified as E. cuniculi genotype I.

AB  - Androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles are human pregnancies with no embryos
      and affect 1 in every 1,400 pregnancies. They have mostly androgenetic
      monospermic genomes with all the chromosomes originating from a haploid sperm and
      no maternal chromosomes. Androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles were described 
      in 1977, but how they occur has remained an open question. We identified
      bi-allelic deleterious mutations in MEI1, TOP6BL/C11orf80, and REC114, with roles
      in meiotic double-strand breaks formation in women with recurrent androgenetic
      complete hydatidiform moles. We investigated the occurrence of androgenesis in
      Mei1-deficient female mice and discovered that 8% of their oocytes lose all their
      chromosomes by extruding them with the spindles into the first polar body. We
      demonstrate that Mei1(-/-) oocytes are capable of fertilization and 5% produce
      androgenetic zygotes. Thus, we uncover a meiotic abnormality in mammals and a
      mechanism for the genesis of androgenetic zygotes that is the extrusion of all
      maternal chromosomes and their spindles into the first polar body.

LID - 10.5152/eurjrheum.2018.18079 [doi]
AB  - Pachydermodactyly is a rare digital fibromatosis, characterized by painless,
      fusiform swelling in proximal interphalangeal joints. Since it may be
      misdiagnosed as inflammatory arthritis, it is important to call physicians'
      attention to this rarely seen condition to avoid unnecessary immunosuppressive
      treatment. Hereby, we present a case of a pachydermodactyly that had been
      previously followed-up and treated as an inflammatory arthritis for 4 years. We
      describe the clinical, radiological, and dermoscopic features of the case.

      this case report is to present a case of an intraosseous schwannoma of the
      calcaneus. A 35-year-old woman was admitted to our outpatients' clinics with a
      complaint of long-time right heel pain (for approximately eight months). After a 
      suspicious cystic lesion was observed on the patient's plain radiograph
      examination, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. The MRI showed a
      22 x 20 mm intraosseous cystic lesion at the posterior part of the calcaneus.
      Extended curettage and iliac bone grafting were performed. In the presence of
      postoperative histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination,
      histopathologic diagnosis of the patient was reported as intraosseous schwannoma.
      After 4 weeks of nonweight-bearing, she completely recovered with no pain. In
      conclusion, intraosseous schwannoma of the calcaneus must be kept in mind for
      patients who have chronic heel pain.

TI  - The positive immunostaining of TMPRSS2-ERG is not associated with unfavourable
      outcomes and biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in Turkish
      patients.

AB  - Introduction: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and a major
      significant health problem amongst men in the world. Radical prostatectomy with
      open, laparoscopic and robotic techniques is the gold standard treatment for
      localized and local advanced disease. There are some risk factors including
      gleason score, T stage and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level to predict the
      biochemical recurrence. We investigated the association with biochemical
      recurrence and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in patients who were treated with open radical 
      prostatectomy. Material and methods: The expression of TMPRSS2:ERG was defined as
      positive (Group 1) and negative (Group 2). The positive staining of the patients 
      is classified into three groups; weak positive, moderate positive and strong
      positive. In the statistical analyses; chi squared test and Mann Whitney U were
      used and p <0.05 was defined as statistical significance. Results: The present
      study includes 87 patients, 32 and 55 patients were in group 1 and 2
      respectively. The mean age of the patients was 62.81 +5.55 and 64.45 +5.18 in the
      groups without significant difference. Extraprostatic extension was reported in
      27 patients; 11 of these patients were in group 1 and 16 patients were in group 2
      (p = 0.60). Biochemical recurrence was detected in 15 patients. Of these
      patients, 5 were in group 1 and 10 were in group 2 (p = 0.76). Conclusions: The
      current study found no association between TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and biochemical
      recurrence and unfavourable pathological results in Turkish patients. Further
      research including a large number of patients from different regions of Turkey is
      needed to investigate the ERG status and biochemical recurrence for patients.

TI  - Neuroendocrine tumor incidentally detected during living donor hepatectomy: A
      case report and review of literature.
PG  - 780-784
LID - 10.4254/wjh.v10.i10.780 [doi]
AB  - To our best knowledge, no case of a tumor that was incidentally detected during
      living donor hepatectomy (LDH) has been reported in the English language medical 
      literature. We present two cases in which grade I neuroendocrine tumors (NET)
      were incidentally detected during our twelve-year LDH experience. First Case: A
      26-year-old male underwent LDH for his brother suffering from HBV-related chronic
      liver disease (CLD). After right lobe LDH, intestinal length was measured as part
      of a study concerning the relationship between small intestinal lengths and
      surgical procedure. At this stage, a mass lesion with a size of 10 mm x 10 mm was
      detected on the antimesenteric surface, approximately 90 cm proximal to the
      ileocecal valve. A wedge resection with primary intestinal anastomosis was
      performed. Second Case: A 29-year-old male underwent right lobe LDH for his
      father with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related CLD. An abdominal exploration
      immediately prior to the closure of the incision revealed that the appendix
      vermiformis was edematous and had firmness with a size of 8-10 mm at its tip. An 
      appendectomy was performed. The pathological examinations of the specimens of
      both patients revealed grade 1 NET. In conclusion, even if patients undergoing
      LDH are healthy individuals, whole abdominal cavity should be gently palpated and
      all findings recorded after completing laparotomy. Suspected masses or lesions
      should be confirmed by frozen section examination. Such an approach would avert
      potential medicolegal issues.

TI  - Effects of oral isotretinoin on normal and wounded nasal mucosa: an experimental 
      study.
PG  - 3025-3031
LID - 10.1007/s00405-018-5190-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the effect of systemic isotretinoin therapy
      on normal and wounded nasal septal mucosa histopathologically in an experimental 
      rabbit model. METHODS: Circular mucosal defect with a 7 mm diameter was made in
      the left septum of 12 New Zealand white rabbits. The rabbits were divided into
      two groups (six rabbits in each group) oral isotretinoin was given with olive oil
      at the operation day to the first group. The control group was only oil given
      group. The harvested septum mucosas were divided into four groups (1-wounded-drug
      given side, 2-unwounded and drug-given side, 3-wounded-control and
      4-unwounded-control side). The diameter of the defect, mucosal thickness,
      epithelial thickness, ciliated cell level, goblet cell level and inflammation
      were evaluated every week for 4 weeks. RESULTS: At both wounded and normal side, 
      thinning of normal respiratory ciliated epithelium was observed in the
      postoperative period. In study group at the wounded side; mean mucosal thickness 
      was measured 139.66 micro (+/- 26.24), and in the control group, mean mucosal
      thickness was 238.33 micro (+/- 39.7) at the wounded side. (p < 0.001). The
      difference between the groups in thickness of normal septal mucosa was also
      statistically significant (p = 0.016) [190 micro (+/- 14.6) and 256.66 micro (+/-
      44.66)]. The average cilia level was observed 1.16 in the wounded study group,
      while the average level was 2.33 in the wounded control group (p = 0.012).
      Average score measurements of the regenerated mucosa suggested that
      isotretinoin-given wounded animals have reduced goblet cell recovery, compared to
      the control both on the regenerated and unwounded mucosas (p = 0.007, p = 0.002, 
      respectively). Inflammation was significantly higher in the wounded isotretinoin 
      group (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Oral isotretinoin has negative effects on
      epithelial and ciliary regeneration, significantly reduces mucosal thickness and 
      goblet cell counts of the normal and regenerated mucosa, causes severe
      inflammation and significant reactive changes.

AB  - The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of Listeria spp. in stray
      dogs in the Kayseri province of Turkey. In addition, serotyping, genotyping and
      virulence gene analysis of the isolated Listeria spp. were performed and their
      pathogenicity and antibacterial susceptibility were investigated. The study
      included 80 rectal swaps taken from 80 stray dogs of different ages and gender
      that were sheltered in the Kayseri Municipal Dog Shelter. Listeria selective
      broth and Listeria selective agar were used for the isolation of Listeria spp.
      and the isolates were identified using a Microbact 12L (Oxoid, England)
      identification test kit. 16S rDNA sequencing and species-specific polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) were performed for molecular identification of the isolates,
      multiplex PCR and a serological test were performed for serotyping, and PCR was
      used for virulence gene analysis. For determining the pathogenicity of L.
      monocytogenes and L. innocua isolates, a total of 100 mice (50 pregnant and 50
      non-pregnant) were used. The mice were infected intraperitoneally; the
      inoculation dose was 1x10(9)CFU/mL and 0.2mL was used for each animal. Tissue
      samples obtained from infected mice were processed for the re-isolation of the
      Listeria spp. and then stained with hematoxylin eosin and Brown-Brenn Gram stain.
      The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by the disk
      diffusion method. Listeria spp. were isolated from 5 (6.25%) of the 80 fecal
      samples. While 1 of the isolates was identified as L. monocytogenes, 4 of them
      were identified as L. innocua. Serotyping by serological and molecular methods
      revealed the isolate of L. monocytogenes to be serotype 1/2a. According to the
      phylogenetic trees, L. innocua and L. monocytogenes strains were clustered in
      different groups. The L. monocytogenes isolate was positive for all virulence
      genes tested. All L. innocua isolates were positive for the plcB gene. While all 
      L. innocua isolates were negative for the lin1068 gene, 3 L. innocua isolates
      were found to be positive for the lin0558 gene. In mice infected with L.
      monocytogenes, pathological findings were observed in the uterus, intestines,
      pancreas, and heart. In mice infected with L. innocua, pathological findings were
      observed in the stomach, intestines and spleen. L. monocytogenes- or L.
      innocua-related infections or other inflammatory reactions were not observed in
      the brains of infected animals. On histopathological examination with Gram stain,
      an abundance of Listeria spp. was observed in the lesions of the liver, spleen,
      uterus, and kidney. Moreover, while abortion was observed in all animals infected
      with L. monocytogenes, it was not observed in any of the animals infected with L.
      innocua. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that all 5 isolates were
      sensitive to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamicin,
      penicillin G, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and were resistant to nalidixic
      acid, streptomycin, and cefuroxime sodium. Considering also the pathogenicity of 
      the isolated microorganisms, it can be suggested that stray dogs as carriers of
      Listeria spp. are a significant risk to public health. As L. innocua isolates,
      which are considered apathogenic, led to the occurrence of lesions similar to
      those caused by L. monocytogenes, detailed studies on the pathogenesis of L.
      innocua infections caused by L. innocua isolates recovered from various sources
      are required.

AB  - Smokers have a risk of developing periodontal disease. Matrix metalloproteinases 
      (MMP) play a significant role in periodontal tissue destruction. In this study
      possible relationship between smoking and gingival tissue expression of
      gelatinases in chronic periodontitis patients relative to periodontally healthy
      subjects was investigated. Forty chronic periodontitis patients (20 smokers and
      20 non-smokers) and forty periodontally healthy subjects (20 smokers and 20
      non-smokers) were enrolled. The clinical periodontal measurements recorded, and
      gingival tissues harvested after that. After histologic evaluation, matrix
      metalloproteinases -2 and -9 expressions were analyzed immunohistochemically. In 
      nonsmokers, higher expression of metalloproteinases -2 and -9 detected in chronic
      periodontitis group compared to the periodontally healthy group. In the smoker
      chronic periodontitis group, the expression of metalloproteinases-2 was lower
      than nonsmoker chronic periodontitis group. Statistically significant differences
      detected between smoker and nonsmoker periodontally healthy groups in
      metalloproteinases-2 expression. For metalloproteinases-9 expression, smoker
      chronic periodontitis group has lower values than nonsmoker chronic periodontitis
      group. In periodontally healthy group smokers showed higher metalloproteinases -9
      expressions than non- smokers. Present findings support the role of gelatinases
      in chronic periodontitis pathogenesis. Based on the current results we conclude
      that smoking alters the expression of gelatinases in gingival tissues.

TI  - Histological heterogeneity in a large clinical cohort of juvenile idiopathic
      inflammatory myopathy: analysis by myositis autoantibody and pathological
      features.
LID - 10.1111/nan.12528 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) have been recently
      reclassified into clinico-serological subgroups. Myopathological correlates of
      the subgroups are incompletely understood. METHODS: We studied muscle biopsies
      from 101 children with clinically and serologically-defined juvenile IIM from the
      UK JDM Cohort and Biomarker Study by applying the international JDM score tool,
      myopathological review, and C5b-9 complement analysis. RESULTS: Autoantibody data
      were available for 90/101 cases with 18/90 cases positive for anti-TIF1gamma,
      15/90 anti-NXP2, 11/90 anti-MDA5, 5/90 anti-Mi2, and 6/90 anti-PmScl. JDM biopsy 
      severity scores were consistently low in the anti-MDA5 group, high in the
      anti-Mi2 group, and widely distributed in the other groups. Biopsies were
      classified histologically as perifascicular atrophy (22/101), macrophage-rich
      necrosis (6/101), scattered necrosis (2/101), clustered necrosis (2/101),
      inflammatory fibre invasion (2/101), chronic myopathic change (1/101), diffuse
      endomysial macrophage infiltrates (40/101), and minimal change (24/101). MDA5
      cases segregated with the minimal change group and showed no capillary
      C5b-9-deposition. The Mi2 group displayed high severity scores and a tendency
      towards sarcolemmal complement deposition. NXP2 and TIF1gamma groups showed a
      variety of pathologies with a high proportion of diffuse endomysial macrophage
      infiltrates and a high proportion of capillary C5b-9 deposition. CONCLUSION: We
      have shown that juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies have a spectrum of
      histopathological phenotypes and show distinct complement attack complex
      deposition patterns. Both correlate in some cases with the serological subtypes. 
      Most cases do not show typical histological features associated with
      dermatomyositis (e.g. perifascicular atrophy). In contrast, more than half show
      relatively mild histopathological changes. This article is protected by

TI  - Clinical and histopathological features of immunoglobulin G4-associated
      autoimmune hepatitis in children.
LID - 10.1111/jgh.14525 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We aimed to examine the frequency and the characteristics of 
      immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-associated autoimmune hepatitis among pediatric patients
      with autoimmune hepatitis. METHODS: Immunostaining for IgG and IgG4 was performed
      in liver biopsies of 40 pediatric patients with autoimmune hepatitis. The
      patients with more than 10 IgG4-positive plasma cells/high-power field were
      defined as IgG4-associated autoimmune hepatitis. Clinic, laboratory, and
      histopathological results were compared between groups. RESULTS: Among the 40
      pediatric patients, 34 patients were type 1 and 6 patients were type 2 autoimmune
      hepatitis. Six patients (15%), four of the type 1 and two of the type 2
      autoimmune hepatitis patients, were diagnosed with IgG4-associated autoimmune
      hepatitis. Clinical, laboratory, and histopathological data were initially
      similar in both forms. There was a positive correlation between IgG4-positive
      plasma cell count and degree of portal (r: 0.406, P: 0.009) and lobular
      inflammation (r: 0.37, P: 0.019), grade of interface hepatitis (r: 0.33, P:
      0.03), and fibrosis (r: 0.318, P: 0.046). Time required for normalization of
      liver transaminases and serum IgG level was significantly shorter in
      IgG4-associated autoimmune hepatitis (3.3 +/- 0.5 vs 6.6 +/- 3.5 for alanine
      aminotransferase, 3.7 +/- 0.8 vs 6.7 +/- 1.2 for aspartate aminotransferase, 4.3 
      +/- 1.2 vs 7.1 +/- 2.7 for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and 7.2 +/- 3.1 vs 12.8
      +/- 4.5 for IgG). CONCLUSIONS: Immunoglobulin G4-associated autoimmune hepatitis 
      can be found in pediatric age group and also in type 2 autoimmune hepatitis
      patients. As steroid response may be better in IgG4-associated autoimmune
      hepatitis, biopsy specimens should be evaluated for this entity at diagnosis.

TI  - Cyclophosphamide-induced severe acute hepatitis in a rheumatic disease:
      case-based review.
LID - 10.1007/s00296-018-4189-8 [doi]
AB  - In rheumatology practice, the risk of hepatotoxicity from medications, including 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, notably, and methotrexate, sulfasalazine, 
      leflunomide, and azathioprine is highly recognized by the rheumatologists. On the
      other hand, hepatotoxicity is neither a commonly expected nor a well-known side
      effect of cyclophosphamide (CYC) which is particularly used for vital organ
      involvements in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic vasculitis. Here 
      we reported a 19-year-old case of SLE who, while on oral CYC treatment of 100
      mg/day, was detected to have asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation and then
      developed acute hepatitis due to intravenously administered high-dose (1 g) CYC
      for neuro-lupus. Results of liver biopsy indicated drug-related toxicity. We
      discussed here with the other, although rare, cases available in the literature
      with an attempt to highlight the risk of hepatotoxicity and acute hepatitis due
      to CYC.

      myringotomy in a rat model?
LID - 10.1007/s00405-018-5181-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, our aim was to identify the possible effects of
      montelukast sodium (ML) on the prevention of experimentally induced
      myringosclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight female Wistar albino rats
      were used and they were divided into four groups randomly. Tympanic membranes
      (TM) of all animals were perforated and then group 1 received no treatment
      (control group), group 2 was treated with a topical saline solution, group 3
      received topically ML and group 4 received orally ML. On the 15th day, all
      animals were euthanized. Tympanic membranes were evaluated otomicroscopically and
      histopathologically. RESULTS: The histopathological findings, compared against a 
      control and saline groups, showed the topically and orally ML groups had
      statistically significant differences of degree of myringosclerosis (p < 0.002)
      and median thickness of the TMs (p < 0.001). Suppression of inflammation was
      statistically significant only in the oral ML treatment group (p < 0.002).
      CONCLUSION: Oral and topically administration of ML reduced myringosclerosis
      formation in myringotomies rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine, in a multi-ethnic/racial, prospective SLE inception
      cohort, the frequency, attribution, clinical and autoantibody associations with
      lupus psychosis and the short and long-term outcome as assessed by physicians and
      patients. METHODS: Patients were evaluated annually for 19 neuropsychiatric (NP) 
      events including psychosis. SLE disease activity 2000, SLICC/ACR damage index and
      SF-36 scores were collected. Time to event and linear regressions were used as
      appropriate. RESULTS: Of 1,826 SLE patients, 88.8% were female, 48.8% Caucasian. 
      The mean+/-SD age was 35.1+/-13.3 years, disease duration 5.6+/-4.2 months and
      follow-up 7.4+/-4.5 years. There were 31 psychotic events in 28/1,826 (1.53%)
      patients and most [(26/28; 93%)] had a single event. In the majority of patients 
      [20/25; (80%)] and events [28/31; (90%)] psychosis was attributed to SLE, usually
      within 3 years of SLE diagnosis. Positive associations [hazard ratio and 95%
      confidence interval [HR (95%CI)] with lupus psychosis were prior SLE NP events
      [3.59, (1.16, 11.14), male sex [3.0, (1.20, 7.50)], younger age at SLE diagnosis 
      [(per 10 years younger), 1.45 (1.01, 2.07)] and African ancestry [4.59 (1.79,
      11.76)]. By physician assessment most psychotic events resolved by the second
      annual visit following onset, in parallel with an improvement in patient reported
      SF-36 summary and subscale scores. CONCLUSION: Psychosis is an infrequent
      manifestation of NPSLE. Generally, it occurs early after SLE onset and has a
      significant negative impact on health status. As determined by patient and
      physician report, the short and long term outlook is good for most patients,
      though careful follow-up is required. This article is protected by copyright. All

PG  - 148-152
LID - 10.14744/nci.2017.60565 [doi]
AB  - Solitary cecal diverticulitis is a rare clinical condition. Like diverticulitis
      in other segments of the colon, it requires immediate surgical intervention if it
      is causing complications. Solitary cecal diverticulitis may be misdiagnosed as
      acute appendicitis, since it causes right lower quadrant pain, or as a cecal
      tumor or inflammatory bowel disease, due to an intraoperative appearance
      resembling an inflammatory mass. Four patients with solitary cecum diverticulitis
      presenting with acute right lower quadrant pain are discussed in this report.
      Three patients underwent surgery with a preliminary diagnosis of acute
      appendicitis or cecal tumor, and 1 patient was diagnosed with cecal
      diverticulitis and treated medically. The treatment approach may change depending
      on a preoperative or intraoperative diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis. Therefore,
      in areas where this disease is uncommon, cecum diverticulitis should not be
      forgotten in the differential diagnosis of acute right lower quadrant pain or
      inflammatory bowel mass.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A unilateral sinonasal mass is a common pathology in ear, nose, and
      throat clinical practice. However, it may be confused with early stage
      inflammatory pathologies. The aim of this study was to examine the diagnostic
      histopathological, clinical, and radiological criteria for a unilateral nasal
      mass. METHODS: The present study examined the clinical and pathological profiles 
      of unilateral sinonasal masses observed in patients at an ear, nose, and throat
      clinic in Istanbul between January 2008 and January 2016. During the period of
      this retrospective study, 195 patients presented with a single-sided sinonasal
      mass (males: 130, females: 65; age range: 9-93 years). The data analyzed were
      obtained from patient records. RESULTS: The single-sided sinonasal mass was
      benign in 187 (95.9%) cases and malignant in 8 (4.1%) cases. Inflammatory polyps 
      (81.03%) were the most frequent benign finding. Squamous cell carcinoma (1.54%)
      was the most commonly diagnosed malignant lesion. CONCLUSION: A single-sided
      sinonasal mass is commonly detected by otorhinolaryngologists. Although most
      often the diagnosis is inflammatory nasal polyposis, the risk of malignancy
      should not be overlooked. For this reason, careful endoscopic examination should 
      be performed, all lesions should undergo a pathological examination, and it
      should be kept in mind that neoplastic disease can occur at any age and may be
      associated with many symptoms.

AB  - Neuroendocrine carcinoma is one of the uncommonly seen pathologies of the urinary
      bladder. Macroscopic hematuria is frequently encountered symptom in patients with
      neuroendocrine carcinoma. We report a 45-year-old man with left solitary kidney
      and oliguria for five days the development of acute renal failure (ARF) with the 
      impaired general condition. The underlying cause being identified as pure type
      large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder. Large-cell neuroendocrine
      carcinoma of the bladder is an uncommon fatal tumor. No macroscopic hematuria or 
      urological symptom was observed in our case. Advanced ectasia was not observed in
      the kidney, and the patient's clinical status was complicated with ARF. It must
      not be forgotten that in some bladder tumors, the patient's general condition may
      be impaired without urological symptoms.

      histopathological and double immunohistochemistry examinations. The results
      showed that hesperidin and chrysin significantly decreased the levels of MDA and 
      inflammatory parameters and significantly increased GSH, SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px
      levels against colistin-induced renal injury. The results also showed that
      cystatin C and calbindin D28K immunopositivities significantly increased through 
      hesperidin and chrysin treatment. Hesperidin and chrysin alleviated the renal
      injury induced by colistin via anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.
      Thus, hesperidin and chrysin could attenuate colistin-induced nephrotoxicity via 
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Addition of hesperidin or chrysin
      to the treatment protocol of colistin treatment might benefit patient treatment
      in terms of the prevention of colistin-induced renal injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: L-theanine is the unique amino acid found in tea plants, has
      antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities, and functions in mental
      concentration and sleep quality. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the
      effects of L-theanine on doxorubicin (DOX, a chemotherapeutic agent) induced
      nephrotoxicity in rats, especially via GSH related enzymes. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: 32 male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 300-400 g were randomly assigned
      into 4 groups (n = 8) and the substances were given intraperitoneally to them:
      Control group (saline for 5 days); Theanine group (200 mg/kg/day theanine for 5
      days); DOX group (single dose of 20 mg/kg DOX); DOX + Theanine group (20 mg/kg
      DOX at first day and 200 mg/kg/day theanine for 5 days). Kidney tissues were
      evaluated by histopathological analysis. Serum levels of blood urea nitrogen
      (BUN) and creatinine by spectrophotometrically; percentage of apoptosis indexes
      (AI%) in the tissues by TUNEL method; caspase-3 levels, reduced and oxidized
      glutathione (GSH and GSSG), gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1), glutathione
      reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase
      (GST), nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-kB p65) by commercial kits; malondialdehyde
      (MDA) by spectrophotometrically were determined in plasma and kidney tissues.
      RESULTS: According to DOX group, the DOX + Theanine group has much lower tissue
      and plasma GSSG, GGT1, NF-kappaB p65 levels and tissue AI%, whereas significantly
      higher GSH levels and GPx, GR, GST activities (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It is
      suggested that L-theanine may have protective effects by enhancing effects on the
      antioxidant system of GSH and GSH-related enzymes against DOX-induced
      nephrotoxicity in rats. But this finding needs to be supported with further
      studies.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: The aim of this study was to investigate the oxidative damage and
      inflammatory effects in the hippocampus and cerebellum in lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-induced sepsis model and possible ameliorating effects of pregabalin (PG). 
      METHODS: Twenty four female Wistar Albino rats (12 month old) were divided into 3
      groups as follows: Group I (Control; 0.1 ml/gavage and i.p. saline, single dose),
      Group II (LPS; 5 mg/kg LPS, i.p, single dose), Group III (LPS + PG; 5 mg/kg LPS, 
      i.p, single dose + 30 mg/kg, gavage, single dose). DNA damage, ischemia-modified 
      albumin (IMA), total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS)
      oxidative stress index (OSI), leukocyte (WBC), lymphocyte, neutrophil, hemoglobin
      (HGB), erythrocyte (RBC), and thrombocyte counts were measured in blood and brain
      tissues. Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation of Caspase- 3,
      G-CSF, IL-6, SAA, iNOS expressions were conducted using hippocampus and
      cerebellum tissues. RESULTS: Comet analysis score, lymphocytes, neutrophils, WBC,
      IMA, TOS and OSI values were increased in Group II compared with to Group I (p < 
      0.05). IMA levels in blood, TOS and OSI levels in the brain were significantly
      decreased in Group III compared to Group II (p < 0.05). We observed increased
      hemorrhages, neutrophils, leukocytes infiltrations and neuron degeneration in
      Group II compared to Group I. Caspase 3, G-CSF, IL-6, SAA, iNOS expressions were 
      increased in group II compared to Group I (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pregabalin
      partly ameliorated the damage caused by the exposure to LPS in hippocampus and
      cerebellum; however, further studies are needed to determine pregabalin's
      possible protective effects at different doses and with different techniques.

      Outcomes.
PG  - 1699-1705
LID - 10.1097/IGC.0000000000001368 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of rectosigmoid resection
      (RR) and Douglas peritonectomy (DP) on postoperative complications and survival
      in advanced-stage ovarian cancer surgery. METHODS/MATERIALS: Patients who
      underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery including RR and DP between January 2007 
      and January 2013 were included. Patients with deeper invasion into the muscularis
      and mucosal layer reported in pathology results and colon wall injury
      necessitating suturing or resection suggesting invasion of implants into the
      colon wall were excluded. The decision for RR or DP was made according to the
      surgical team and patients' preference. Resections were performed with the
      suspicion of colon wall invasion. The collected data were age, previous
      operations, preoperative cancer antigen 125 and albumin levels, surgical
      procedures, duration of surgery, tumor histology, recurrence, hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and length of hospital stay. Kaplan-Meir survival
      estimates were calculated and compared between the groups using the log-rank
      test. Cox proportional models were built to evaluate factors that affected
      disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Age, body mass index, preoperative
      cancer antigen 125 levels, albumin levels, and amount of ascites were similar
      between the groups. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking
      surgery was performed in 15% of both groups. End colostomy was performed in 23.7%
      of the RR group, and only 5.08% of the patients underwent diverting ileostomy
      procedures. There was no significant difference in terms of surgical
      complications between the groups. Recurrence occurred in the RR and DP groups at 
      rates of 42% and 47%, respectively. Only primary debulking surgery had an effect 
      on overall survival (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.88).
      Overall survival and disease-free survival were similar in the RR and DP groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Douglas peritonectomy showed similar survival and surgical outcomes 
      to RR and provided shorter hospital stay and earlier admission to chemotherapy in
      the management of serosal implants during advanced-stage ovarian cancer surgery.

      experience.
PG  - 1-5

AB  - The aim of this study is to present our clinical experience about
      fertility-sparing procedures in early stage cervical cancer and its obstetrical
      and oncological outcomes. Between the years 2006 and 2016, a total of 22 early
      stage cervical cancer patients who underwent a fertility-sparing radical
      abdominal trachelectomy in our clinic were retrospectively analysed. The median
      age was 33 (range: 28-39) years. The median follow-up was 47 (range: 22-125)
      months. Five patients (22.7%) had Stage IA1, three patients had (13.6%) Stage
      IA2, and 14 patients (63.6%) had Stage IB1 disease. Only one patient had a
      recurrence. A pregnancy was obtained in five patients (22.7%) and one of them
      (20%) had a live birth. A pregnancy was obtained spontaneously in two patients
      (40%), whereas assisted reproductive techniques were used in three of the
      patients (60%). A miscarriage occurred in two patients (40%), and one of them was
      within the first trimester and the other was within the second trimester. Impact 
      statement What is already known on the subject? Currently, the first-line
      treatment of early stage cervical cancer is surgery. However, a fertility-sparing
      trachelectomy is the most widely adopted approach in the reproductive aged
      patients who have a desire to be pregnant later. What does this study add? In the
      literature, there is a growing number of studies on this subject. However, it
      would take time to obtain adequate knowledge. We believe that our study would
      contribute to the existing data. What are the implication of these findings for
      clinical practice? This study is important as it indicates that a
      multidisciplinary approach is required to preserve fertility among gynaecologic
      oncologists and the outcomes would be reflected into the clinical practice. In
      addition, we believe that our study would pave the way for further studies
      regarding this subject among oncologists.

AB  - Random skin flaps are essential tools in reconstructive surgery. In this study,
      we investigated the effect of subdermal nitrous oxide (N2O) application on random
      flap survival. In this experimental study, we used 21 female rats in three
      groups. In the N2O and air groups, gases were administrated under the proposed
      dorsal flap areas daily for seven days. Following the treatment period, flaps
      were raised and inserted back into their place from the dorsal skin. In the
      control group, the flaps were elevated and inserted back to their place without
      any pretreatment. Calculation of necrotic flap areas, histological examination
      and microangiography was performed to evaluate the results 7 days after the flap 
      surgery. The average of necrotic flap area in the N2O, air and control group was 
      13.45%, 37.67% and 46.43%, respectively. (N2O vs air p = .044; N2O vs control p =
      .003). The average number of capillary formations identified in the histological 
      analysis was 7.0 +/- 1.58, 3.75 +/- 2.36 and 4.4 +/- 0.54 in the N2O, air and
      control group, respectively. (N2O vs air p = .017; N2O vs control p = .037). The 
      average number of capillary structures identified in the angiography images were 
      6.3 +/- 1.52, 1.6 +/- 1.15 and 1.3 +/- 0.57 in the N2O, air and control group,
      respectively. (N2O vs air p = .04; N2O vs control p = .02). We conclude that
      subdermal N2O application increases random flap survival through an increase in
      the skin microcirculation and could be promising for future clinical
      applications.

TI  - A comparison study of the reporting systems for salivary gland fine needle
      aspirations: Are they really different?
PG  - 859-863
LID - 10.1002/dc.24037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently a new system for reporting salivary gland fine-needle
      aspiration (FNA) cytology was proposed, the Milan System for Reporting Salivary
      Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC). Herein, we evaluated diagnostic accuracy of
      salivary gland FNA, comparing the system previously used in our hospital with the
      Milan system. METHODS: Salivary gland specimens obtained between 2011 and 2017
      were reclassified according to MSRSGC. Risk of malignancy for each diagnostic
      category was determined. Diagnostic yield of both classifications was evaluated. 
      RESULTS: The cases (n = 388) were classified according to the old system:
      nondiagnostic (n = 28), benign (n = 246), atypical (n = 36), neoplastic (n = 57),
      suspicious for malignancy (n = 7) and malignant (n = 14). The lesions were
      distributed according to the MSRSGC: nondiagnostic (n = 28), non-neoplastic (n = 
      89), atypia of undetermined significance (n = 39), benign neoplasm (n = 156),
      neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential (n = 55), suspicious for malignancy (n 
      = 7) and malignant (n = 14). When considering only benign and malignant cases,
      both classifications showed the same sensitivity (62.5%), specificity (100%) and 
      similar accuracy (95.8%). Comparison between the two systems showed no
      significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Salivary gland FNA has high diagnostic
      accuracy and assists clinical management independently of the reporting system
      used, however, in some cases, the use of Milan system could be beneficial, since 
      it allows an enhanced category stratification.

AB  - The 1,2,4-triazole and its derivatives were reported to exhibit various
      pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial, analgesic, anti-inflammatory,
      antitumoural, cytotoxic, and antioxidant properties. In this study, a series of
      triazole compounds (M1-M10) were evaluated for some biological activities. In
      vitro qualifications of these compounds on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and human 
      carbonic anhydrase enzyme activities were performed. Also, their antitumoral
      activities in human colon cancer (HT29) cell line cultures were examined. In
      addition, colon cancer experimentation was induced in rats by an in vivo method, 
      and the in vivo anticancer effects of triazole derivatives were investigated.
      Also, the effects of these derivatives in levels of antioxidant vitamin A,
      vitamin E, and MDA were studied in rat liver and blood samples. Most of the
      compounds were found to exhibit significant antioxidant and antitumoral
      activities. All the compounds had cytotoxic activities on HT29 cell lines with
      their IC50 values lower than 10 microM concentrations. The low IC 50 values of
      the compounds are M1 (3.88 microM), M2 (2.18 microM), M3 (4.2 microM), M4 (2.58
      microM), M5 (2.88 microM), M6 (2.37 microM), M7 (3.49 microM), M8 (4.01 microM), 
      M9 (8.90 microM), and M10 (3.12 microM).

TI  - Prognostic Importance of Tumor Deposits in the Ipsilateral Axillary Region of
      Breast Cancer Patients.
LID - 10.1007/s12253-018-0515-4 [doi]
AB  - Tumor deposits (TD) are irregular discrete tumor masses in adipose tissue,
      discontinuous from the primary tumor, that are described in various cancers. The 
      incidence and/or prognostic value of TD in breast carcinomas have not been
      studied so far. We reevaluated 145 breast cancer patients, diagnosed and treated 
      between 2001 and 2006 at our institution for the presence and incidence of TD.
      Histologic type, grade, size of the primary tumor, estrogen receptor,
      progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status of the
      tumor, and presence of peritumoral lymphovascular invasion were included in the
      data. TD were detected in 42 cases (29.0%). The mean age of the patients was 52.2
      years (27-82). Most patients (79.3%) had either invasive carcinoma of no special 
      type (NST) or invasive lobular carcinoma, and most tumors (86.9%) were either
      grade 2 or 3. After excluding TD from the number of metastatic lymph nodes, the
      pN status of 9 patients changed. Univariate analysis of 110 patients with
      follow-up information revealed that the new pN status (p = 0.036), presence of
      local recurrence (p = 0.016) and TD (p = 0.003) were significantly correlated
      with distant metastases. The median follow-up of the patients was 84 months
      (5-161), 10-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 67.2% and 73.7%,
      respectively. In multivariate analysis, presence of TD remained independently
      associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.002). The probability of distant
      metastasis was 3.3 times higher in patients with TD. These results emphasize that
      TD are present in breast cancer patients, and that their presence should warn the
      clinician in terms of possible distant metastasis. Therefore, presence of TD, the
      evaluation of which is neither time consuming nor require sophisticated methods, 
      should be included in pathology reports.

TI  - Comparison of Monitor-Image and Printout-Image Methods in Ki-67 Scoring of
      Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.
LID - 10.1007/s12022-018-9554-3 [doi]
AB  - Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) are classified according
      to tumor grade. Ki-67 and mitotic count are the two determinants of this
      classification. Therefore, Ki-67 scoring becomes very important in classifying
      the patients accurately. Eye-balling, counting of cells through the microscope,
      automated image analysis systems, and manual counting of printed image are the
      four major scoring methods in use. The aim of this study is to show the agreement
      between monitor-image method (MIM) and printout-image method (PIM) of Ki-67
      scoring. In our study, 120 GEP-NETs from 85 patients diagnosed between January
      2005 and July 2017 were evaluated. Thirty-seven cases with either polypectomy or 
      resection material were selected. Seven different scoring methods using either a 
      monitor-image or a printout-image were applied for Ki-67 scoring. They are as
      follows: whole-PIM, 1/9-PIM, whole-MIM, 1/4-MIM, 1/6-MIM, 1/9-MIM, and 1/12-MIM. 
      In the comparison of Ki-67 scoring methods, intraclass correlation coefficients
      ranging from 0.951 to 0.999 were found. The Bland-Altman analysis showed
      near-perfect agreement between whole-MIM and whole-PIM as well as 1/9-MIM and
      1/9-PIM. The level of agreements among the other methods were sufficient too, but
      there was a relative decrease in the level of agreement as the area of counting
      becomes smaller. The average application time decreased from 373.7 to 41.7 s
      gradually as the scoring area becomes smaller. Our study shows that there is a
      remarkable agreement between the MIM and PIM used in Ki-67 scoring.

TI  - The effects of lutein on optic nerve injury induced by ethambutol and isoniazid: 
      an experimental study.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/15569527.2018.1539010 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Ethambutol and isoniazid are two major effective first line agents in
      tuberculosis treatment having some visual adverse effects. We aimed to determine 
      the protective effects of lutein on oxidative optic neuropathy induced by
      ethambutol and isoniazid in an experimental model. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Totally
      24 albino Wistar male rats were assigned into 4 groups, with 6 rats in each group
      as follows: healthy controls (HC group), 50 mg/kg ethambutol +50 mg/kg isoniazid 
      administered group (EI), 0.5 mg/kg lutein +50 mg/kg ethambutol +50 mg/kg
      isoniazid administered group (LEI-05) and only Lutein (0.5 mg/kg) (LUT group)
      administered group. From the blood samples and tissues obtained from the rats,
      Malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (GSH), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) and
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were studied. Histopathological
      evaluations were performed at the end of the study. RESULTS: Serum and tissue
      IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and MDA levels were the highest in EI group which were
      significantly lower in lutein administered group. On the other hand, serum and
      tissue total GSH levels were the lowest in EI group which were significantly
      higher in Lutein administered group. In histopathological evaluations, there were
      significant differences between EI group and all other three groups with edema
      and hemorrhage in connective tissue covering optic nerve, dilated and congested
      capillary, decrease in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSION: Isoniazid and
      ethambutol induced toxic optic neuropathy although not common, may have some
      potential devastating effects on vision. Lutein is determined as an effective
      agent in prevention of isoniazid and ethambutol induced toxic optic neuropathy.

TI  - Phase 3 Study of Recombinant von Willebrand Factor in Patients With Severe von
      Willebrand Disease Who Are Undergoing Elective Surgery.
LID - 10.1111/jth.14313 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) has demonstrated efficacy
      for on-demand treatment of bleeding in severe von Willebrand disease (VWD),
      warranting evaluation in the surgical setting. OBJECTIVES: This study
      (NCT02283268) evaluated the hemostatic efficacy/safety profile of rVWF,
      with/without recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII), in patients with severe VWD
      undergoing surgery. PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients received rVWF 40-60 IU/kg, VWF
      ristocetin cofactor activity was measured 12-24 hours before surgery. If
      endogenous FVIII activity (FVIII:C) target levels were achieved 3 hours before
      surgery, rVWF was administered alone 1 hour before surgery; rVWF was
      coadministered with rFVIII if target endogenous FVIII levels were not achieved.
      rVWF was infused postoperatively to maintain target trough levels. Overall and
      intraoperative hemostatic efficacy, the pharmacodynamics of rVWF administration
      and the incidence of adverse events (AEs) were assessed. RESULTS: All patients
      treated with rVWF for major (n=10), minor (n=4), and oral (n=1) surgery had
      overall and intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings of excellent (73.3% and
      86.7%) or good (26.7% and 13.3%). Most rVWF infusions (89.4%) were administered
      alone, resulting in hemostatically effective levels of endogenous FVIII within 6 
      hours, that were sustained for 72-96 hours; 70% (n=7/10) of major surgeries were 
      performed without rFVIII coadministration. Six patients reported 12
      treatment-emergent AEs. Two patients each had 1 serious AE: diverticulitis (not
      treatment related) and deep vein thrombosis (sponsor assessed as possibly
      treatment-related). No severe allergic reactions or inhibitory antibodies were
      reported. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the efficacy and safety profile of rVWF
      in patients with severe VWD undergoing elective surgery. This article is

TI  - Blood Vessel Invasion in Endometrial Cancer Is One of the Mechanisms of Spread to
      the Cervix.
LID - 10.1007/s12253-018-0498-1 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate the association between type of invaded vessels (blood or lymphatic) 
      and cervical involvement in endometrial cancer (EC). Pathological slides of 93
      patients with EC who had vascular space invasion in hematoxylin-eosin staining
      underwent immunohistochemical assay with CD31 and podoplanin. CD31 and podoplanin
      were used to identify blood and lymphatic invaded vessels, respectively. Cervical
      stromal invasion (CSI) was determined in 21 (30%) patients. The rate of
      CD31-positivity was significantly higher in patients with CSI than without (76.2 
      and 34.7%, p = 0.001; respectively). Podoplanin-positivity was determined in 47.6
      and 81.6% of patients with and without CSI, respectively (p = 0.005). Age,
      myometrial invasion and the combination of CD31-positivity with
      podoplanin-negativity were found as independent predictors for CSI. Blood vessel 
      invasion is an important factor for CSI in EC. Blood vessel invasion rather than 
      lymphatic vessel invasion is one of the predominant ways by which EC spreads to
      the cervix.

TI  - Imaging in secondary tumors of the ovary.
LID - 10.1007/s00261-018-1809-4 [doi]
AB  - Metastatic involvement of the ovaries is not rare. The most common tumor types
      metastasizing to the ovaries, from non-gynecological organs, are breast,
      colorectal, gastric, and appendix tumors. Lymphogenous, hematogenous, and
      transcoelomic pathways have all been proposed among potential pathways. Early
      diagnosis and treatment have an important potential to improve the patient
      outcome. Krukenberg tumors typically appear as complex semisolid masses with
      varying amounts of solid and cystic components. Ovarian metastases from the colon
      primaries are predominantly cystic in nature. Secondary lymphomatous involvement 
      of ovary is mostly bilateral and solid with heterogeneous signal intensity on
      MRI. Metastatic breast cancer to the ovaries is typically bilateral and tends to 
      be of small size. Among all the other imaging characteristics, bilateral
      involvement of secondary tumors of the ovary appears to be most potentially
      helpful finding in differentiating from primary ones.

TI  - Dilated Minute Chambers in Laryngeal Vocal Fold Polyps: Histopathological and

LID - 10.1016/j.jvoice.2018.09.017 [doi]
AB  - In Reinke's space of human vocal fold, type III collagen forms a three
      dimensional network and this contains numerous minute chambers in between these
      fibers. These compartments are occupied by glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins. 
      In laryngeal fold lesions, such as Reinke's edema and vocal fold polyps,
      proteoglycan (PG)/hyaluronic acid (HA) components of extracellular matrix
      increased. We investigated the size and quantity of the minute chambers within
      Reinke's space, filled with PG/HA with the aid of transmission electron
      microscopy. Eight vocal fold polyps and 10 mucosal biopsies (as control group)
      were all evaluated by light microscopy and electron microscopy. We detected that 
      PG/HA in extracellular matrix had been increased in vocal fold lesions when
      compared with control group, by Alcian Blue-pH 2.5 stain. The mean volume of the 
      chambers in Reinke's space of normal larynx was measured as 0.040233 microm(2)
      whereas the mean volume of these chambers in vocal fold polyps was measured as
      6.420221 microm(2). The difference between the volumes of these chambers in vocal
      fold polyps and in control group was statistically significant (P=0.001). Within 
      these chambers PG/HA were found and PG/HA filling these chambers were increased
      in vocal fold polyps. We think proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycans, especially
      HA, play an important role in determining biochemical properties of vocal fold
      lesions.

AB  - GOAL: We evaluated the potential for prenatal diagnosis of merosin-negative
      muscular dystrophies by immunohistochemistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a
      retrospective study of 12 pregnancies with merosin-negative muscular dystrophy in
      a prior child. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) was performed between 11th to 13th
      gestational weeks. Merosin immunohistochemical studies were performed on
      trophoblastic cells. RESULTS: Two of 12 were "merosin-negative," both were from
      the same family. Fetal ultrasonographies were evaluated as normal in these
      pregnancies. Eight of the 10 merosin-positive cases delivered healthy babies. Two
      were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Prenatal diagnosis of merosin-negative
      muscular dystrophies can be accomplished by immunohistochemical analysis.

TI  - N-cadherin expression in primary and metastatic testicular germ cell tumors.
PG  - 1125-1129
AB  - PURPOSE: Upregulation of N-cadherin in epithelial tumor cells has been reported
      to enhance the invasive process. Although the distribution of N-cadherin in the
      normal testis was demonstrated, there is no adequate information regarding its
      presence in testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs). Our purpose was to examine the
      expression and localization of N-cadherin in germ cell tumors of the testis and
      share our experience. METHODS: 104 adult cases of primary and metastatic
      testicular GCTs, 5 germ cell neoplasia in situ and 15 benign testicular tissues
      were included into the study and analyzed for immunoexpression of N-cadherin.
      Positive expression was evaluated according to intensity and localization of the 
      staining. RESULTS: In 34 pure seminomas, 6 seminomas of mixed component and 16
      metastatic seminomas, N-cadherin expression was observed with variable staining
      intensity. Two pure yolk sac tumors and 20 out of 34 mixed GCTs with yolk sac
      components were positive for N-cadherin. In contrast, neither the embryonal and
      chorionic carcinomas nor the teratomas showed N-cadherin expression. CONCLUSIONS:
      N-cadherin immunexpression should be interpreted considering both staining
      intensity and extent. In case of a metastatic tumor of unknown primary showing
      prominent N-cadherin expression, seminoma should be considered in the
      differential diagnosis. At the same time Ncadherin staining could be used to
      differentiate seminomas from embryonal carcinomas with solid components in
      metastatic GCTs, both having similar histopathological findings. On the other
      hand, the diagnostic value is not obvious for nonseminomatous tumors.

TI  - A crowdsourced analysis to identify ab initio molecular signatures predictive of 
      susceptibility to viral infection.
PG  - 4418
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-06735-8 [doi]
AB  - The response to respiratory viruses varies substantially between individuals, and
      there are currently no known molecular predictors from the early stages of
      infection. Here we conduct a community-based analysis to determine whether pre-
      or early post-exposure molecular factors could predict physiologic responses to
      viral exposure. Using peripheral blood gene expression profiles collected from
      healthy subjects prior to exposure to one of four respiratory viruses (H1N1,
      H3N2, Rhinovirus, and RSV), as well as up to 24 h following exposure, we find
      that it is possible to construct models predictive of symptomatic response using 
      profiles even prior to viral exposure. Analysis of predictive gene features
      reveal little overlap among models; however, in aggregate, these genes are
      enriched for common pathways. Heme metabolism, the most significantly enriched
      pathway, is associated with a higher risk of developing symptoms following viral 
      exposure. This study demonstrates that pre-exposure molecular predictors can be
      identified and improves our understanding of the mechanisms of response to
      respiratory viruses.

AB  - Chordomas are rare malignant tumors that develop from the residual of embryonic
      notochord. These tumors may be seen along the spine and have a local aggressive
      progression. Skull base chordomas often originate from the clivus as
      localization. These tumors are usually found to be overgrown when they are
      diagnosed. They are locally invasive and rarely develop distant metastasis. These
      chordomas cannot usually be completely removed due to their localization. Because
      these tumors are advanced at the time of diagnosis and are adjacent to important 
      structures, they are among the tumors with high rates of mortality and morbidity.
      Surgery and/or radiotherapy is administered for the treatment.

TI  - Urotensin receptors as a new target for CLP induced septic lung injury in mice.
LID - 10.1007/s00210-018-1571-8 [doi]
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction condition response resulting in
      acute lung injury. Urotensin II (UII), an endogenous vasoactive peptide, is
      widely distributed in pulmonary, cardiovascular, central nervous, renal and
      metabolic systems, and especially in inflammatory regions. This study aimed to
      investigate whether urotensin II (UII) and UII receptor (UTR) antagonists play a 
      role in the inflammatory response to sepsis-induced lung damage and they are
      possible therapeutic targets. In the study, 78 male Balb-c mice were used. A
      cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced polymicrobial sepsis model was applied,
      and the effects of human urotensin II (agonist) and urantide and palosuran
      (antagonists) were investigated on lung tissues. Glutathione and malondialdehyde 
      levels and SOD activity of lung tissues were investigated in addition to
      TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, NF-kappaB, and UTR mRNA levels. Also, lung sections
      were histopathologically evaluated. Urantide and palosuran, UII receptor
      antagonists, decreased proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta,
      IL-6, NF-kappaB, and also decreased oxidative stress parameters in lung tissue,
      which are markers of damage. UTR mRNA expression was increased in septic lungs,
      and both antagonists significantly decreased the elevated receptor level. Also,
      histopathological examination showed beneficial effects of both agonists on lung 
      tissue. The results of this study help to understand the inflammatory and
      therapeutic contribution of the UII/UTR system on sepsis-induced lung damage. We 
      can suggest that UTR receptor antagonists may be evaluated as a potential drug
      which reduces sepsis-induced lung damage in the future.

TI  - Phenotypic expansion in DDX3X - a common cause of intellectual disability in
      females.
PG  - 1277-1285
LID - 10.1002/acn3.622 [doi]
AB  - De novo variants in DDX3X account for 1-3% of unexplained intellectual disability
      (ID) cases and are amongst the most common causes of ID especially in females.
      Forty-seven patients (44 females, 3 males) have been described. We identified 31 
      additional individuals carrying 29 unique DDX3X variants, including 30 postnatal 
      individuals with complex clinical presentations of developmental delay or ID, and
      one fetus with abnormal ultrasound findings. Rare or novel phenotypes observed
      include respiratory problems, congenital heart disease, skeletal muscle
      mitochondrial DNA depletion, and late-onset neurologic decline. Our findings
      expand the spectrum of DNA variants and phenotypes associated with DDX3X
      disorders.

TI  - The ARID1B spectrum in 143 patients: from nonsyndromic intellectual disability to
      Coffin-Siris syndrome.
LID - 10.1038/s41436-018-0330-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Pathogenic variants in ARID1B are one of the most frequent causes of
      intellectual disability (ID) as determined by large-scale exome sequencing
      studies. Most studies published thus far describe clinically diagnosed
      Coffin-Siris patients (ARID1B-CSS) and it is unclear whether these data are
      representative for patients identified through sequencing of unbiased ID cohorts 
      (ARID1B-ID). We therefore sought to determine genotypic and phenotypic
      differences between ARID1B-ID and ARID1B-CSS. In parallel, we investigated the
      effect of different methods of phenotype reporting. METHODS: Clinicians entered
      clinical data in an extensive web-based survey. RESULTS: 79 ARID1B-CSS and 64
      ARID1B-ID patients were included. CSS-associated dysmorphic features, such as
      thick eyebrows, long eyelashes, thick alae nasi, long and/or broad philtrum,
      small nails and small or absent fifth distal phalanx and hypertrichosis, were
      observed significantly more often (p < 0.001) in ARID1B-CSS patients. No other
      significant differences were identified. CONCLUSION: There are only minor
      differences between ARID1B-ID and ARID1B-CSS patients. ARID1B-related disorders
      seem to consist of a spectrum, and patients should be managed similarly. We
      demonstrated that data collection methods without an explicit option to report
      the absence of a feature (such as most Human Phenotype Ontology-based methods)
      tended to underestimate gene-related features.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Novel Genomic Regions Associated with 10
      Grain Minerals in Synthetic Hexaploid Wheat.
LID - E3237 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms19103237 [doi]
AB  - Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW; Triticum durum L. x Aegilops tauschii Coss.) is a
      means of introducing novel genes/genomic regions into bread wheat (T. aestivum
      L.) and a potential genetic resource for improving grain mineral concentrations. 
      We quantified 10 grain minerals (Ca, Cd, Cu, Co, Fe, Li, Mg, Mn, Ni, and Zn)
      using an inductively coupled mass spectrometer in 123 SHWs for a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS). A GWAS with 35,648 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      markers identified 92 marker-trait associations (MTAs), of which 60 were novel
      and 40 were within genes, and the genes underlying 20 MTAs had annotations
      suggesting a potential role in grain mineral concentration. Twenty-four MTAs on
      the D-genome were novel and showed the potential of Ae. tauschii for improving
      grain mineral concentrations such as Ca, Co, Cu, Li, Mg, Mn, and Ni.
      Interestingly, the large number of novel MTAs (36) identified on the AB genome of
      these SHWs indicated that there is a lot of variation yet to be explored and to
      be used in the A and B genome along with the D-genome. Regression analysis
      identified a positive correlation between a cumulative number of favorable
      alleles at MTA loci in a genotype and grain mineral concentration. Additionally, 
      we identified multi-traits and stable MTAs and recommended 13 top 10% SHWs with a
      higher concentration of beneficial grain minerals (Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, and Zn), a
      large number of favorable alleles compared to low ranking genotypes and checks
      that could be utilized in the breeding program for the genetic biofortification. 
      This study will further enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture of 
      grain minerals in wheat and related cereals.

AB  - Detecting morphological changes of dendritic spines in time-lapse microscopy
      images and correlating them with functional properties such as memory and
      learning, are fundamental and challenging problems in neurobiology research. In
      this paper, we propose an algorithm for dendritic spine detection in time series.
      The proposed approach initially performs spine detection at each time point and
      improves the accuracy by exploiting the information obtained from tracking of
      individual spines over time. To detect dendritic spines in a time point image we 
      employ an SVM classifier trained by pre-labeled SIFT feature descriptors in
      combination with a dot enhancement filter. Second, to track the growth or loss of
      spines, we apply a SIFT-based rigid registration method for the alignment of
      time-series images. This step takes into account both the structure and the
      movement of objects, combined with a robust dynamic scheme to link information
      about spines that disappear and reappear over time. Next, we improve spine
      detection by employing a probabilistic dynamic programming approach to search for
      an optimum solution to accurately detect missed spines. Finally, we determine the
      spine location more precisely by performing a watershed-geodesic active contour
      model. We quantitatively assess the performance of the proposed spine detection
      algorithm based on annotations performed by biologists and compare its
      performance with the results obtained by the noncommercial software NeuronIQ.
      Experiments show that our approach can accurately detect and quantify spines in
      2-photon microscopy time-lapse data and is able to accurately identify spine
      elimination and formation.

TI  - MicroRNAs as prognostic markers in prostate cancer.
LID - 10.1002/pros.23731 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in
      men who are especially over the age of 50 years in the western countries.
      Currently used therapeutic modalities mostly fail to give positive clinical
      outcomes and nearly 30% of the PCa patients eventually develop clinical
      recurrence. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of PCa progression
      is of paramount importance to help determining the course of disease. In this
      study, we aimed at profiling the differentially expressed microRNAs in recurrent 
      PCa samples. METHODS: We profiled the microRNA expression of 20 recurrent and 20 
      non-recurrent PCa patients with microRNA microarray, and validated the
      differential expression of significantly deregulated microRNAs in 40 recurrent
      and 39 non-recurrent PCa specimens using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
      (qRT-PCR). Data were statistically analyzed using two-sided Student's t-test,
      Pearson Correlation test, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
      RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that a total of 682 probes were significantly
      deregulated in recurrent versus non-recurrent PCa specimen comparison. Among
      those, we confirmed the significant downregulation of miR-424 and upregulation of
      miR-572 with further qRT-PCR analysis in a larger sample set. Further ROC
      analysis showed that these microRNAs have enough power to distinguish recurrent
      specimens from non-recurrent ones on their own. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report that
      differential expression of miR-424 and miR-572 in recurrent PCa specimens can
      serve as novel biomarkers for prediction of PCa progression.

TI  - Endoscopic Findings of Children with Familial Mediterranean Fever.
PG  - 271-277
LID - 10.5223/pghn.2018.21.4.271 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an auto inflammatory disease
      characterized by periodic fever, synovitis and serositis. Patients may be
      admitted to gastroenterology units due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In this
      study; we aimed to analyze endoscopic findings and diagnostic utility of
      endoscopic procedure in children with FMF. Methods: Patient with FMF that was
      performed endoscopy for the gastrointestinal symptoms were included to the study 
      (39 of 164 patients, 53 procedure). A control group was randomly designed as age 
      and gender matched four endoscopic procedures per one endoscopic procedure of
      patients with FMF (n=212). Results: No different was found between the patients
      and control group in esophagogastroscopy findings. However, the diagnosis of
      gastrointestinal pathology was made by esophagogastroscopy in 46.2% patients.
      Colonoscopic examination revealed that the frequency of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) was higher in undiagnosed patients compared to both the control
      group (50.0% vs. 6.9%, p<0.05, odds ratio [OR]:13.4 and 95% confidence inteval
      [95% CI]: 2.1-84.3) and the patients under colchicine treatment (50.0% vs. 8.3%, 
      p<0.05, OR: 11 and 95% CI: 0.8-147.8). Colonoscopic procedure that was made after
      the diagnosis was found to provide contribution by 16.7% in determining the
      etiology of the additional symptoms. Conclusion: Patients with FMF may be
      admitted to pediatric gastroenterology outpatient clinic prior to diagnosis or
      during the follow-up period. The frequency of IBD is high in undiagnosed patients
      with FMF. Endoscopic procedures may be helpful in these patients for the
      diagnosis accompanying mucosal lesions.

TI  - An adult case of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome presented with posterior
      reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Successful response to late-onset eculizumab 
      treatment.
PG  - 7553
LID - 10.4081/hr.2018.7553 [doi]
AB  - Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare and progressive disease caused by
      uncontrolled alternative complement activation. Dysregulation of the complement
      activation results in thrombotic microangiopathy and multiorgan damage. A
      29-yearold woman who was admitted with complaints of vomiting and headache was
      detected to have acute renal failure with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
      (MAHA). After the diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), she was
      treated with plasma exchange (PE) and hemodialysis (HD). She has experienced
      hypertensionrelated posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) at the
      second plasma exchange. She was initiated on eculizumab therapy because of no
      response to PE on the 34(th) days. Her renal functions progressively improved
      with eculizumab treatment. Dependence on dialysis was over by the 4(th) month.
      Dialysis free-serum Creatinine level was 2.2 mg/dL [glomerular filtration rate
      (e-GFR): 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)] after 24 months. Neurological involvement (PRES,
      etc.) is the most common extrarenal complication and a major cause of mortality
      and morbidity from aHUS. More importantly, we showed that renal recovery may be
      obtained following late-onset eculizumab treatment in patient with aHUS after a
      long dependence on hemodialysis.

TI  - Smoking induces coordinated DNA methylation and gene expression changes in
      adipose tissue with consequences for metabolic health.
PG  - 126
LID - 10.1186/s13148-018-0558-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a risk factor for multiple diseases, including
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Many smoking-associated signals have been
      detected in the blood methylome, but the extent to which these changes are
      widespread to metabolically relevant tissues, and impact gene expression or
      metabolic health, remains unclear. METHODS: We investigated smoking-associated
      DNA methylation and gene expression variation in adipose tissue biopsies from 542
      healthy female twins. Replication, tissue specificity, and longitudinal stability
      of the smoking-associated effects were explored in additional adipose, blood,
      skin, and lung samples. We characterized the impact of adipose tissue smoking
      methylation and expression signals on metabolic disease risk phenotypes,
      including visceral fat. RESULTS: We identified 42 smoking-methylation and 42
      smoking-expression signals, where five genes (AHRR, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYTL1, F2RL3)
      were both hypo-methylated and upregulated in current smokers. CYP1A1 gene
      expression achieved 95% prediction performance of current smoking status. We
      validated and replicated a proportion of the signals in additional primary tissue
      samples, identifying tissue-shared effects. Smoking leaves systemic imprints on
      DNA methylation after smoking cessation, with stronger but shorter-lived effects 
      on gene expression. Metabolic disease risk traits such as visceral fat and
      android-to-gynoid ratio showed association with methylation at smoking markers
      with functional impacts on expression, such as CYP1A1, and at tissue-shared
      smoking signals, such as NOTCH1. At smoking-signals, BHLHE40 and AHRR DNA
      methylation and gene expression levels in current smokers were predictive of
      future gain in visceral fat upon smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      provide the first comprehensive characterization of coordinated DNA methylation
      and gene expression markers of smoking in adipose tissue. The findings relate to 
      human metabolic health and give insights into understanding the widespread health
      consequence of smoking outside of the lung.

LID - 10.1186/s12885-018-4890-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the HPV positivity rate in
      patients with laryngeal cancer, and to determine the effect of HPV positivity on 
      survival. An additional aim was to determine if patients with HPV positive
      laryngeal cancer are more sensitive to chemotherapy and if such sensitivity
      differs according to chemotherapy protocol. METHODS: The study included laryngeal
      specimens obtained from 82 laryngeal cancer patients and 11 laryngeal specimens
      with normal laryngeal mucosa that were obtained from our hospital's paraffin
      block archives between 1995 and 2013. HPV was detected via chromogenic in situ
      hybridization (cISH) and confirmed via genotyping. RESULTS: HPV was not detected 
      in any of the 82 laryngeal cancer patients' laryngeal specimens, nor in any of
      the 11 archived laryngeal specimens with normal laryngeal mucosa via cISH.
      Genotyping confirmed these findings; none of the HPV types studied were detected 
      in any of the specimens. As none of the study samples were HPV positive, it was
      not possible to compare survival, recurrence, or chemotherapy sensitivity.
      CONCLUSIONS: HPV infection is not a leading cause of laryngeal cancer; however,
      additional research on HPV positivity in patients with laryngeal cancer and its
      effect on recurrence, survival, and chemotherapy sensitivity is warranted.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coley, in 1892, reported 14 cases of a hydrocele in women. He
      described this "affection" as being "too rare an anomaly to deserve
      consideration. The rarity of this finding continues to be described in more
      current literature of 400 cases. CASE PRESENTATION: 42-year-old woman presented
      to the clinic with a palpable mass in her left inguinal region. On physical
      examination, a soft-consistency, mobile mass of about 4 cm in size was seen in
      the left inguinal region. The cystic lesion which was seen to be originated from 
      the inguinal canal was excised in the exploration made by suspending the round
      ligament by passing through the anatomical folds with the incision made from the 
      left inguinal region. The defect was repaired with prolene mesh after high
      ligation. Patient was discharged on the 1st postoperative day. DISCUSSION: In
      women, a round ligament is attached to the uterus close to the origin of the
      fallopian tubes, and the extension of the parietal peritoneum follows the round
      ligament as it passes to the inguinal canal through the internal ring. Hydroceles
      of the canal of Nuck were not conclusively diagnosed until surgery was performed 
      on a suspected inguinal hernia. The treatment of Nuck canale hydroceles are
      surgery. Ligating the prosessus vaginalis and excision of the cyst in surgical
      treatment will prevent recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Nuck canal cysts should be
      considered in the differential diagnosis of cases of female patient's complaints 
      of swelling in the inguinal region.

TI  - Pneumococcal colonization among tracheostomy tube dependent children.
PG  - e0206305
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0206305 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization is a precursor to pneumococcal disease.
      Although children with a tracheostomy have an increased risk of pneumococcal
      pneumonia, the pneumococci colonizing their lower airways remain largely
      uncharacterized. We sought to compare lower respiratory tract isolates colonizing
      tracheostomy patients and a convenience sample of isolates from individuals
      intubated for acute conditions. We collected pneumococcal isolates from the lower
      respiratory tract of 27 patients with a tracheostomy and 42 patients intubated
      for acute conditions. We compared the penicillin susceptibility, rates of
      co-colonization, genetic background, and serotype of isolates colonizing these
      patient populations. Isolates from both groups showed high genetic diversity.
      Forty multi-locus sequence types and 20 serotypes were identified. There was no
      significant difference in serotype distribution, co-colonization rates, vaccine
      coverage, or non-susceptibility to penicillin among pneumococcal isolates from
      the two groups. Colonization of the lower airways with non-vaccine serotypes
      15B/C, 23B and 35B was noted for the first time in patients with tracheostomies
      and supports recently observed increases in nasopharyngeal colonization and
      disease due to these serotypes.

TI  - Response to Early Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation Is not Sustained in CoQ10
      Deficiency Caused by CoQ2 Mutation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COQ2 mutations cause a rare infantile multisystemic disease with
      heterogeneous clinical features. Promising results have been reported in response
      to Coenzyme Q10 treatment, especially for kidney involvement, but little is known
      about the long-term outcomes. METHODS: We report four new patients from two
      families with the c.437G-->A (p.Ser146Asn) mutation in COQ2 and the outcomes of
      two patients after long-term coenzyme Q10 treatment. RESULTS: Index cases from
      two families presented with vomiting, nephrotic range proteinuria, and diabetes
      in early infancy. These patients were diagnosed with coenzyme Q10 deficiency and 
      died shortly after diagnosis. Siblings of the index cases later presented with
      neonatal diabetes and proteinuria and were diagnosed at the first day of life.
      Coenzyme Q10 treatment was started immediately. The siblings responded
      dramatically to coenzyme Q10 treatment with normalized glucose and proteinuria
      levels, but they developed refractory focal clonic seizures beginning at three
      months of life that progressed to encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort with
      CoQ10 deficiency, neurological involvement did not improve with oral coenzyme Q10
      treatment despite the initial recovery from the diabetes and nephrotic syndrome.

TI  - Management of Gonads in Adults with Androgen Insensitivity: An International
      Survey.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1159/000493645 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complete and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS, PAIS) are
      associated with an increased risk of gonadal germ cell cancer (GGCC). Recent
      guidelines recommend gonadectomy in women with CAIS in late adolescence.
      Nevertheless, many adult women prefer to retain their gonads. AIMS: This study
      aims to explore attitudes towards gonadectomy in AIS in centres around the world,
      estimate the proportion of adults with retained gonads and/or who developed GGCC,
      and explore reasons for declining gonadectomy. METHODS: A survey was performed
      among health care professionals who use the International DSD Registry (I-DSD).
      RESULTS: Data were provided from 22 centres in 16 countries on 166 women (CAIS)
      and 26 men (PAIS). In CAIS, gonadectomy was recommended in early adulthood in 67%
      of centres; 19/166 (11.4%) women refused gonadectomy. Among 142 women who had
      gonadectomy, evidence of germ cell neoplasm in situ (GCNIS), the precursor of
      GGCC, was reported in 2 (1.4%) out of 8 from whom pathology results were formally
      provided. Nine out of 26 men with PAIS (34.6%) had retained gonads; 11% of
      centres recommended routine gonadectomy in PAIS. CONCLUSION: Although development
      of GGCC seems rare, gonadectomy after puberty is broadly recommended in CAIS; in 
      PAIS this is more variable. Overall, our data reflect the need for evidence-based
      guidelines regarding prophylactic gonadectomy in AIS.

AB  - Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease with mononuclear cell
      infiltration and destruction of the lacrimal gland and salivary glands, which
      cause dryness of the eyes and mouth. The most common neurological condition seen 
      in SS is peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestation of SS as an acute fulminant
      peripheral neuropathy is extremely rare. We report a 42-year-old patient
      presenting with acute motor sensory-axonal neuropathy in the presence of SS. She 
      showed partial response to intravenous immunoglobulin but favourable clinical
      improvement was seen after initiation of corticosteroid treatment.

TI  - Change in standardized uptake values in delayed 18F-FDG positron emission
      tomography images in hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - Delayed 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging has been associated with improved diagnostic yield in several
      malignancies; however, data on the use of delayed imaging in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is scarce. This study aimed to examine tumoral and
      background standardized uptake value (SUV) alterations in dual-phase F-FDG
      PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging.Fifty-two HCC cases underwent
      dual-time-point F-FDG PET/CT examination where early and delayed images were
      obtained. The maximum and mean SUVs (SUVmax and SUVmean) of the tumor were
      determined for both time points. Similarly, the average SUVmean were also
      determined for background (liver, soft tissue, and spleen). Changes in tumoral
      and background SUV between early and delayed images were examined.The mean age
      was 62.0 +/- 12.9 years (range, 20-88 years) and the majority of the patients
      were men (86.5%). Tumor SUVs, both tumor SUVmean and tumor SUVmax, significantly 
      increased at delayed images when compared to early images. In contrast, the
      average SUVmean for the liver, soft tissue, and spleen significantly decreased at
      delayed images.A significant increase in tumor SUV in delayed images in contrast 
      to a significant decrease in background SUVs suggests that delayed images in HCC 
      may contribute to diagnostic performance through a potential increase in the
      contrast between the tumor and background. However, further studies with larger
      sample sizes including patients with benign lesions and different grades of the
      disease are warranted to better elucidate the diagnostic contribution as well as 
      the association of delayed imaging values with prognosis.

TI  - Forensic age diagnostics by magnetic resonance imaging of the proximal humeral
      epiphysis.
LID - 10.1007/s00414-018-1952-z [doi]
AB  - The most commonly used radiological method for age estimation of living
      individuals is X-ray. Computed tomography is not commonly used due to high
      radiation exposure, which raises ethical concerns. This problem can be solved
      with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which avoids the use of
      ionizing radiation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the utility 
      of MRI analysis of the proximal humeral epiphyses for forensic age estimations of
      living individuals. In this study, 395 left proximal humeral epiphyses (patient
      age 12-30 years) were evaluated with fast-spin-echo proton density-weighted image
      (FSE PD) sequences in a coronal oblique orientation on shoulder MRI images. A
      five-stage scoring system was used following the method of Dedouit et al. The
      intra- and interobserver reliabilities assessed using Cohen's kappa statistic
      were kappa = 0.818 and kappa = 0.798, respectively. According to this study,
      stage five first appeared at 20 and 21 years of age in males and females,
      respectively. These results are not directly comparable to any other published
      study due to the lack of MRI data on proximal humeral head development. These
      findings may provide valuable information for legally important age thresholds
      using shoulder MRI. The current study demonstrates that MRI of the proximal
      humerus can support forensic age estimation. Further research is needed to
      establish a standardized protocol that can be applied worldwide.

TI  - Can computer-aided diagnosis assist in the identification of prostate cancer on
      prostate MRI? a multi-center, multi-reader investigation.
PG  - 33804-33817
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.26100 [doi]
AB  - For prostate cancer detection on prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), the
      Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) and
      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems aim to widely improve standardization
      across radiologists and centers. Our goal was to evaluate CAD assistance in
      prostate cancer detection compared with conventional mpMRI interpretation in a
      diverse dataset acquired from five institutions tested by nine readers of varying
      experience levels, in total representing 14 globally spread institutions. Index
      lesion sensitivities of mpMRI-alone were 79% (whole prostate (WP)), 84%
      (peripheral zone (PZ)), 71% (transition zone (TZ)), similar to CAD at 76% (WP,
      p=0.39), 77% (PZ, p=0.07), 79% (TZ, p=0.15). Greatest CAD benefit was in TZ for
      moderately-experienced readers at PI-RADSv2 <3 (84% vs mpMRI-alone 67%, p=0.055).
      Detection agreement was unchanged but CAD-assisted read times improved (4.6 vs
      3.4 minutes, p<0.001). At PI-RADSv2 >/= 3, CAD improved patient-level specificity
      (72%) compared to mpMRI-alone (45%, p<0.001). PI-RADSv2 and CAD-assisted mpMRI
      interpretations have similar sensitivities across multiple sites and readers
      while CAD has potential to improve specificity and moderately-experienced
      radiologists' detection of more difficult tumors in the center of the gland. The 
      multi-institutional evidence provided is essential to future prostate MRI and CAD
      development.

      with antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta1, cytokeratin,
      E-cadherin, S100A4, alpha-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and nestin to determine
      whether tubule epithelial cells had undergone epithelial-mesenchymal
      transformation (EMT) that resulted in loss of epithelial cells and an increased
      number of mesenchymal cells. Although nephrosis was more common in dogs,
      nephritis was more common in cats; these pathologies developed in both kidneys.
      We found that EMT participated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis in both dogs
      and cats.

      in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 4040787
LID - 10.1155/2018/4040787 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma is an aggressive malignancy of the 
      liver and is ranked as the sixth most common cancer worldwide. There is still
      room for novel markers to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of HCC. Our
      observations in cancer databases that PLXNC1 is upregulated in HCC led us to
      investigate the expression profile of Plexin C1 mRNA and protein in HCC cell
      lines and tissues. Methods: A recombinant protein encompassing part of the
      extracellular domain of Plexin C1 was used as an antigen for monoclonal antibody 
      development. Transcript and protein levels of Plexin C1 in HCC cell lines were
      determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. In vivo evaluation of
      Plexin C1 expression in HCC tissues was accomplished by immunohistochemistry
      studies in tissue microarrays. Results: A monoclonal antibody, clone PE4,
      specific to Plexin C1, was generated. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed a 
      Plexin C1-based clustering of well-differentiated HCC cell lines. Staining of HCC
      and nontumoral liver tissues with PE4 showed a membrane-localized overexpression 
      of Plexin C1 in tumors (p=0.0118). In addition, this expression was correlated
      with the histological grades of HCC cases. Conclusions: Plexin C1 distinguishes
      HCC cells of epithelial characteristics from those with the mesenchymal
      phenotype. Compared to the nontumoral liver, HCC tissues significantly
      overexpress Plexin C1. The newly generated PE4 antibody can be evaluated in
      larger HCC cohorts and might be exploited for the examination of Plexin C1
      expression pattern in other epithelial malignancies.

AB  - Stress ulcers is a trouble complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
      Although gastrointestinal ulcerations may be attributed to increased HCL
      secretion in SAH; the exact mechanism of that complication has not been
      investigated definitively. We studied if vagal network degeneration may cause
      intestinal atrophy following SAH. Study was conducted on 25 rabbits, with 5
      control group (Group-A), 5 SHAM group (Group-B), and 15 SAH group via injection
      of autologue blood to cisterna magna. Seven animals followed for seven days
      (Early Decapitated-Group-C) and eight animals followed 21days (Late
      Decapitated-Group-D). The vagal nodosal ganglia (NGs), Auerbach plexuses and
      goblet cells of duodenums were examined by current stereological methods and
      compared statistically. The mean numbers of degenerated axon density/mm(2) of
      gastric branches of vagal nerves was 8+/-2, 34+/-11, 189+/-49 and 322+/-81 in the
      Group A, B, C, and D respectively. The mean numbers of degenerated neuron
      density/mm(3) of NGs was 5+/-2, 54+/-7, 691+/-87 and 2930+/-410 in the Group A,
      B, C, and D respectively. The mean numbers of degenerated Auerbach neurons 2+/-1,
      4+/-1, 12+/-3 and 27+/-5/mm(3) in the Group A, B, C, and D respectively. The mean
      numbers of degenerated goblet cells/mm(3) were 4.3+/-1.02, 11.5+/-0.26, 143+/-26 
      and 937+/-65 Group A, B, C, and D respectively. Statistical analysis showed that 
      vagal network ischemia could cause intestinal bleeding and so atrophy in SAH
      progression. Statistical analyses of groups were; Group-D/Group-A<0.001,
      Group-D/Group-B<0.005, Group-C/Group-A<0.005. Undiscovered effect of ischemic
      vagal network injuries should be regarded as a major cause of stress ulcerations 
      following SAH which has not been mentioned in the literature.

AB  - AIM OF WORK: This study investigates the factors related to metastasis detection 
      in a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) in patients without clinical axillary
      involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients who underwent 
      an SLN biopsy after diagnosis with early-stage breast cancer were evaluated
      retrospectively. The study sample included 64 patients divided into two groups
      according to the histopathological examination of the SLN biopsy: Group I
      (positive for axillary metastasis) and Group II (negative for axillary
      metastasis). RESULTS: The frequency of lymphovascular invasion was significantly 
      higher in Group I (57%) than in Group II (13%) (p=0.003). The progesterone
      receptor status (p=0.036), tumor T-stage(p=0,047), and Ki-67 index differed
      significantly (p=0.045) between the two groups. While in univariate analysis,
      lymphovascular invasion, T-stage and KI-67 index were significant, in
      multivariate analysis only lymphovascular invasion was found to be significant.
      No significant differences were found in terms of estrogen receptor and HER2
      considering tumor invasion type, histologic grade, vascular invasion, neural
      invasion, multifocality or bilaterality, hormone receptor status, menopause
      status, total number of lymph nodes, presence of non-sentinel lymph nodes and the
      number of SLNs in the groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study
      indicate that lymphovascular invasion is associated with axillary metastasis,
      based on an SLN biopsy.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study is to shorten the decellularization time of
      trachea by using combination of physical, chemical, and enzymatic techniques.
      Methods: Approximately 3.5-cm-long tracheal segments from 42 New Zealand rabbits 
      (3.5+/-0.5 kg) were separated into seven groups according to decellularization
      protocols. After decellularization, cellular regions, matrix and strength and
      endurance of the scaffold were followed up. Results: DNA content in all groups
      was measured under 50 ng/mg and there was no significant difference for the
      glycosaminoglycan content between group 3 (lyophilization+deoxycholic
      acid+de-oxyribonuclease method) and control group (P=0.46). None of the
      decellularized groups was different than the normal trachea in tensile stress
      values (P>0.05). Glucose consumption and lactic acid levels measured from
      supernatants of all decellularized groups were close to group with cells only (76
      mg/dL and 53 mg/L). Conclusion: Using combination methods may reduce exposure to 
      chemicals, prevent the excessive influence of the matrix, and shorten the
      decellularization time.

TI  - Evaluation of the Extent of Vessel Avulsion Injury: An Experimental Study Using a
      Rabbit Model.
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1675178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the extent of damage in vascular avulsion type injuries
      still represents a challenge for the microsurgeon. Excision of the damaged
      section is critical for the success of anastomosis. The purpose of this study was
      to determine which among vascular endothelial and adventitia damage findings is
      most effective in determining the extent of avulsion injury. METHODS: Varying
      degrees of avulsion were applied to the aorta of 12 (n = 12) adult female New
      Zealand rabbits. Avulsion was first determined using adventitial findings and
      then with endothelial findings. The definitive extent of damage was determined
      histopathologically. RESULTS: The mean area of the histopathological sections was
      16.7 +/- 6.9 mm. The extent of damage measured from the adventitia was 15.8 +/-
      7.9 mm (the difference in histopathological examinations was not significant, p =
      0.590, paired t-test), while the extent of damage from the lumen was 13.3 +/- 8.2
      mm (the difference in histopathological examinations was significant p = 0.004,
      paired t-test). CONCLUSION: Excision based on adventitia findings is more
      effective in case of avulsion injury.

TI  - Challenges in the histopathological classification of ganglioglioma and DNT:
      microscopic agreement studies and a preliminary genotype-phenotype analysis.
LID - 10.1111/nan.12522 [doi]
AB  - Low-grade epilepsy-associated brain tumours (LEAT) are the second most common
      cause for drug-resistant, focal epilepsy, i.e. ganglioglioma (GG) and
      dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (DNT). However, molecular pathogenesis, 
      risk factors for malignant progression, and their frequent association with
      drug-resistant focal seizures remain poorly understood. This contrasts recent
      progress in understanding the molecular-genetic basis and targeted treatment
      options in diffuse gliomas. The Neuropathology Task Force of the International
      League against Epilepsy examined available literature to identify common
      obstacles in diagnosis and research of LEAT. Analysis of 10 published tumour
      series from epilepsy surgery pointed to poor interrater agreement for the
      histopathology diagnosis. The Task Force tested this hypothesis using a web-based
      microscopy agreement study. In a series of 30 LEAT, 25 raters from 18 countries
      agreed in only 40% of cases. Highest discordance in microscopic diagnosis
      occurred between GG and DNT variants, when oligodendroglial-like cell patterns
      prevail, or ganglion cells were difficult to discriminate from pre-existing
      neurons. Suggesting new terminology or major histopathological criteria did not
      satisfactorily increase the yield of histopathology agreement in 4 consecutive
      trials. To this end, the Task Force applied the WHO 2016 strategy of integrating 
      phenotype analysis with molecular-genetic data obtained from panel sequencing and
      450k methylation arrays. This strategy was helpful to distinguish DNT from GG
      variants in all cases. The Task Force recommends, therefore, to further develop
      diagnostic panels for the integration of phenotype-genotype analysis in order to 
      reliably classify the spectrum of LEAT, carefully characterize clinically
      meaningful entities and make better use of published literature. This article is

TI  - The impact of single positive surgical margin features on biochemical recurrence 
      after robotic radical prostatectomy.
LID - 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2017.0702 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Parameters predictive of biochemical or clinical recurrence after
      Radical Prostatectomy (RP) were determined as pre-treatment PSA value, pathologic
      tumor stage, tumor grade and presence of Positive Surgical Margin (PSM),
      extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion and the status of pelvic
      lymph nodes. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of additional
      features in patients undergoing RP in our clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      studied 556 RP operations performed between 2009 and 2016 for prostate cancer at 
      this clinic. Preoperative and postoperative data of the patients were
      retrospectively reviewed. RP specimens were examined by two pathologists
      specialized in this subject. Of these patients, 78 (14.02%) patients with PSM
      were included in the study. The pathology slides of these patients were
      reassessed. The length of PSM (mm), localization (apex, basis and posterolateral)
      and Gleason pattern at this margin was determined and statistical correlations
      with BCR were calculated. RESULTS: The mean follow-up after the RP of 41 patients
      included in the study was 37.4 +/- 13.2 months. During the follow-up period of
      the patients, BCR was observed in 16 patients (39.02%). No statistically
      significant difference was observed in age and prostate volume between the groups
      with and without BCR development (p > 0.05). Preoperative PSA level was found to 
      be statistically significantly higher in the group with BCR development compared 
      to the group without recurrence (p = 0.004). In-group comparisons in each
      aforementioned Gleason score groups were performed in terms of BCR development
      and the preoperative Gleason score in the group with development of recurrence
      was found to be statistically significantly higher compared to the group without 
      recurrence (p = 0.007). The length of the surgical margin was measured as 7.4 +/-
      4.4 mm in the BCR-developing group and 4.7 +/- 3.8 mm in the no-BCR- developing
      group; it was statistically significantly higher in the group with development of
      recurrence (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Length and location of the PSM and the Gleason
      score detected in the PSM region could not predict biochemical recurrence
      according to the results of this present study. However high preoperative PSA
      value is an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence.

TI  - Evaluating the Effects of a Topical Preparation Composed of Dexpanthenol,
      Silbiol, Undecylenic Acid and Lidocaine on Palatal Mucosa Wound Healing in a Rat 
      Model.
LID - 10.4274/balkanmedj.2018.0167 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although postoperative complications occurs after periodontal plastic
      surgeries, an ideal treatment has not been found to overcome. AIMS: The aim of
      this study was evaluated the effects of topically applied Oral-norm gel on the
      healing of excisional wounds. STUDY DESIGN: Animal experimentation. METHODS:
      Excisional wounds with a 3 mm diameter were made in the center of the palatal
      mucosa in 63 Sprague Dawley rats. Seven animals were sacrificed at time 0. The
      remaining animals were divided into an experimental group to which topical
      Oral-norm gel was applied three times a day, and a control group to which nothing
      was applied. Seven animals in each group were sacrificed at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days.
      The mean wound surface area (MWSA) was measured, wound healing and width was
      evaluated microscopically. RESULTS: The MWSA decreased significantly after 3 days
      in both groups (p<0.001). After 3 days, the MWSA decreased from 6.62 (2.85) mm(2)
      to 0.83(1.62) mm(2) in control group and 5.07(0.88) mm(2) to 1.42(1.67) mm(2) in 
      test group on day 7. The wound width decreased significantly on day 7 in both
      groups (p<0.001), with no further changes by day 14. Both groups had a
      significant increase in inflammation and vascularization on day 3 (p<0.001), with
      a reduction thereafter. No significant differences in macroscopic and microscopic
      measurements were observed between the groups at any time point (p>0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: No positive healing benefits were observed with the use of Oral-norm
      gel.

TI  - Cryptogenic and Secondary Organizing Pneumonia: Clinical Presentation,
      Radiological and Laboratory Findings, Treatment, and Prognosis in 56 Cases.
LID - 10.5152/TurkThoracJ.2018.18008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Organizing pneumonia is an important disease that is associated with 
      non-specific clinical findings and radiographic appearance. Our aim was to
      examine the clinical and radiological features, laboratory findings, diagnostic
      approach, and response to therapy in subjects with cryptogenic (COP) and
      secondary organizing pneumonia (SOP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients' medical
      records were retrospectively reviewed between 2010 and 2016 in our hospital. We
      analyzed the symptoms, radiological features, pulmonary function tests,
      laboratory data, bronchoalveolar lavage findings, treatment, and prognosis.
      RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with COP and 19 patients with SOP. 
      The most common causes of SOP were determined as rheumatologic diseases. The most
      common symptoms were cough (71.4%) and dyspnea (66.1%). Bilateral symmetrical
      consolidations were the most prominent radiological appearance in both COP and
      SOP. The general radiographic findings were not different in COP and SOP.
      However, pulmonary lesions were located rather in the central (p=0.023) and
      middle (p=0.001) zones in patients with SOP. Corticosteroid (CS) therapy was
      administered to 34 (60.7%) patients. Two patients showed deterioration despite CS
      therapy. CONCLUSION: The clinical and radiographic findings, treatment response, 
      prognosis were similar in patients with COP and SOP.

PG  - 180-182
LID - 10.5152/tao.2018.3317 [doi]
AB  - Chondrolipomas are benign mesenchymal tumors that have two mature tissues
      simultaneously and emerge as a result of cartilaginous metaplasia in lipomas.
      They rarely occur in the head and neck area (1%-4%), and occur more frequently in
      the 60-70 years age group. Although there are cases of the nasopharynx, tongue,
      lip, and neck reported in the literature, we have been able to find only two
      cases on tonsils. The case of a 17-year-old male patient, who presented to our
      clinic complaining of dysphagia and was diagnosed with tonsillar chondrolipoma,
      is described here, along with the radiological, clinical, and immunohistochemical
      findings, as well as the review of the literature.

TI  - Nasopharyngeal Glial Heterotopia with Intracranial Extension: A Case Report.
PG  - 177-179
LID - 10.5152/tao.2018.3204 [doi]
AB  - Nasopharyngeal glial heterotopia is a mass composed of mature neural tissue
      occurring outside the central nervous system and is extremely rare. The
      preoperative diagnosis of such a mass in the head and neck region is challenging.
      In this study, we report a case of a 16-month-old patient presenting with
      respiratory distress and snoring caused by nasopharyngeal glial heterotopia.
      Radiologic imaging and histopathology are obligatory for the definitive diagnosis
      of glial heterotopia. Preoperative evaluation of an intracranial connection is
      one of the most essential issues in the presence of pediatric nasopharyngeal
      masses. The gold standard of treatment is surgical excision. Early recognition
      and early surgical excision by endoscopic or external approach are crucial to
      relieve respiratory distress and to maintain healthy growth and development.

PG  - 293-297
LID - 10.1159/000487750 [doi]
AB  - Background: Primary breast rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) can occur in children. There is
      a lack of knowledge regarding radiologic findings and added diffusion-weighted
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of RMS in the literature. Case Report: 
      A 12-year-old girl was diagnosed with primary alveolar RMS of the breast. Gray
      scale ultrasound revealed posterior acoustic enhancement behind a
      well-circumscribed, multilobulated hypoechoic mass. Doppler ultrasound revealed
      increased peripheral and central vascularity. Hypointense septations on
      T2-weighted image exhibiting more enhancement than the stroma on late
      gadolinium-enhanced images were striking within a hyperintense mass. A
      hyperintense hemorrhagic focus on T1-weighted image was present in the absence of
      any necrosis. Avid enhancement on early postcontrast images proceeding from the
      periphery to the center was depicted. Conclusion: A rapidly enlarging mass with
      an echogenic peripheral rim together with posterior acoustic enhancement on gray 
      scale ultrasound, intense vascularity on Doppler ultrasound, axillary
      lymphadenopathy, and satellite nodules on MRI should raise suspicion. Enhancing
      central and peripheral septations are suggestive of RMS. Dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI in suspected cases can provide valuable data in the
      differential diagnosis.

LID - 10.1159/000492755 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of intratunical 
      injection of platelet rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of Peyronie's disease
      (PD) in a rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats
      (300-350 g) were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham, PD, PD + PRP, and PRP. The
      PD + PRP groups received intratunical injections with 0.1 mL PRP on day 15
      (treatment) or day 0 (PRP effect). Forty-five days following transforming growth 
      factor-beta 1 injection, rats underwent pathological examination. Tissues were
      evaluated histologically for fibrosis grade (Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining), 
      collagen/smooth muscle ratio (Masson Trichrome staining) and type III/type I
      collagen ratio (Picro-sirius red staining). Statistical analysis was performed by
      Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square followed by the Mann-Whitney U test for post hoc
      comparisons. RESULTS: Significant changes were found in all 3 groups compared to 
      the sham group (p < 0.0001 for fibrosis, p = 0.001 for collagen/smooth muscle
      ratio and p = 0.003 for type III/type I collagen ratio). The values in the PRP
      group and the findings in the PD group are similar (p = 0.122 for fibrosis, p =
      0.221 for collagen/smooth muscle ratio and p = 1.0 for type III/type I collagen
      ratio). CONCLUSION: This is the first study of PRP on PD. As a result of
      pathological examinations, PRP shows PD-like effects in rats. PRP may be a cheap,
      easily accessible, and an effective disease model for PD treatment research.

TI  - Cytomorphological Analysis of Thyroid Nodules Diagnosed as Follicular Variant of 
      Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: a Fine Needle Aspiration Study of Diagnostic Clues
      in 42 Cases and the Impact of Using Bethesda System in Reporting-an Institutional
      Experience.
PG  - 351-356
LID - 10.1007/s12022-018-9550-7 [doi]
AB  - Follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) is the second most
      common subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) after classical PTC (cPTC).
      Follicular thyroid lesions such as follicular adenomas/carcinomas, FVPTC, and
      noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features
      (NIFTP) pose some diagnostic challenges for FNAC. In this study, we aimed to
      explore whether FNAC can demonstrate diagnostic clues by re-evaluating cytology
      slides from histopathologically diagnosed FVPTC cases. A total of 42 patients
      were enrolled in this study: patients were diagnosed with FVPTC via surgical
      resection between 2006 and 2016, and all patients were subjected to preoperative 
      FNAC, which was conducted at either a private center or at the teaching hospital 
      of Kocaeli University and reported by the same cytopathologist (NP). Clinical and
      cytomorphological characteristics were reviewed by both authors .Most cases
      (76.2%) are diagnosed either Bethesda IV or V. The majority of cases had a high
      cellularity (38/42; 90.5%), and the most frequent observations were monolayer and
      large syncytial groups of cells (95.2%). While microfollicular structures were
      observed in 30 (71.4%) cases, nuclear crowding and large naked nuclei were
      observed in all cases. Nuclear grooves were sparsely detected in 23 (54.8%)
      cases, and nuclear pseudoinclusions were detected in only six (14.3%) cases.
      Because thyrocytes often have a mixed architecture in FVPTC, despite a distinct
      follicular morphology, we believe that nuclear overcrowding, enlargement, and
      hyperchromasia in cases presenting with increased cellularity are notable clues
      for the cytodiagnosis of FVPTC. We believe that the primary aim of FNAC in such
      cases is to give preoperative diagnosis as either category IV or V. Nuclear
      crowding, monolayered clusters with large syncytial formations, nuclear
      enlargement, and hyperchromasia are notable cytomorphologic clues for the
      diagnosis of FVPTC on FNAC.

      carcinomas arising from endometriotic cysts: is it a myth?
LID - 10.1007/s00404-018-4935-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathologic features
      and the prognostic significance of Stage I ovarian clear cell and endometrioid
      carcinomas arising from endometriotic cysts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with
      either Stage I ovarian clear cell or endometrioid carcinoma were divided into
      three groups. *Group 1: Patients with cancers arising from endometriotic cysts
      *Group 2: Patients with ovarian and pelvic endometriosis *Group 3: Patients
      without endometriosis Patient characteristics (overall survival and disease-free 
      survival) were compared between groups. RESULTS: Of the 78 patients who
      participated in this study, 39 were in group 1, 13 were in group 2, and 26 were
      in group 3. The mean age in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 46 years, 54 years, and 48
      years, respectively (p = 0.39). Tumoral characteristics, including capsule
      rupture, positive cytology, grade, and the presence of synchronous endometrial
      cancer were similar in both groups. The 5-year overall survival rate in groups 1,
      2, and 3 were 100, 90, and 93%, respectively (p = 0.4). Moreover, the recurrence 
      rates did not differ significantly between groups. Furthermore, subgroup analysis
      of clear cell carcinoma and endometrioid adenocarcinoma separately showed no
      effect of endometriosis on disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS). 
      CONCLUSION: Clear cell or endometrioid ovarian carcinoma arising from ovarian
      and/or pelvic endometriosis shares the same clinicopathologic characteristics
      with their counterparts that do not arise from endometriosis and patients have
      similar overall and disease-free survival.

TI  - Updated results from the phase 3 HELIOS study of ibrutinib, bendamustine, and
      rituximab in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma.
LID - 10.1038/s41375-018-0276-9 [doi]
AB  - We report follow-up results from the randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3
      HELIOS trial of ibrutinib+bendamustine and rituximab (BR) for previously treated 
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) without
      deletion 17p. Overall, 578 patients were randomized 1:1 to either ibrutinib (420 
      mg daily) or placebo, in combination with 6 cycles of BR, followed by ibrutinib
      or placebo alone. Median follow-up was 34.8 months (range: 0.1-45.8).
      Investigator-assessed median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached for 
      ibrutinib+BR, versus 14.3 months for placebo+BR (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI],
      0.206 [0.159-0.265]; P < 0.0001); 36-month PFS rates were 68.0% versus 13.9%,
      respectively. The results are consistent with the primary analysis findings (HR =
      0.203, as assessed by independent review committee, with 17-month median
      follow-up). Median overall survival was not reached in either arm; HR (95% CI)
      for ibrutinib+BR versus placebo: 0.652 (0.454-0.935; P = 0.019). Minimal residual
      disease (MRD)-negative response rates were 26.3% for ibrutinib+BR and 6.2% for
      placebo+BR (P < 0.0001). Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events
      (including grades 3-4) were generally consistent with the initial HELIOS report. 
      These long-term data support improved survival outcomes and deepening responses
      with ibrutinib+BR compared with BR in relapsed CLL/SLL.

TI  - Prevalence and Clinical Features of Celiac Disease in Healthy School-Aged
      Children.
LID - 10.1007/s10620-018-5320-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of celiac 
      disease (CD) in healthy school-aged children in the northern region of Cyprus and
      to investigate the existence of potential markers that may accompany CD. This is 
      the first study to measure the prevalence of CD in the northern region of Cyprus.
      METHODS: This study included 3792 school-aged children who were between the ages 
      of 6 and 10 years between January 2015 and October 2016. CD was screened using
      total serum IgA, IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and IgA antiendomysial
      (EMA) antibodies. Subjects with selective IgA deficiency were further tested for 
      IgG-tTG. Small intestinal biopsies were performed on all subjects with tTG
      antibody positivity. Risk factors and symptoms related to CD were evaluated using
      questionnaires in both the CD and control groups. RESULTS: Of the 3792 subjects, 
      39 were antibody positive (IgA-tTG was positive only in 14 subjects, IgA-tTG plus
      IgA-EMA in 21 subjects, and IgG-tTG in 4 subjects). IgA deficiency was detected
      in 11 subjects (0.29%). IgG-tTG was positive in 4 subjects with IgA deficiency
      (36.3%). Intestinal biopsies were performed on 28 of the 39 seropositive
      subjects. The biopsy findings of 15 children were consistent with CD (IgA-tTG
      positive in 3, IgA-tTG and IgA-EMA positive in 10, and IgG-tTG positive in 2).
      Thus, biopsies confirmed CD in 1:256 children (0.39%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study,
      which is the first study of school-aged children from the northern region of
      Cyprus, revealed that CD is a prevalent disease in this region.

      Population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Normal voice can be differentiated from dysphonic voices by comparing
      their characteristics using an established normative database. Pediatric
      normative data using the Phonatory Aerodynamic System (PAS) have been established
      in a preliminary study for English-speaking children. However, aerodynamic
      measures, including physical characteristics varying by geographic region, race, 
      and culture, must be investigated between children with different native
      languages. Aerodynamic analysis of connected speech requires the collection of
      language-specific samples and the establishment of language-specific norms. Thus,
      the main purpose of the present study was to establish pediatric normative data
      using the PAS for a large pediatric population of healthy Turkish-speaking
      children of 4-17.11years of age. Another research aim was to determine
      age-dependent and/or gender-dependent aerodynamic parameters for this pediatric
      population. METHODS: In total, 120 children were divided into four age groups:
      Group I, 4-5.11 years; Group II, 6-9.11 years; Group III, 10-13.11 years; and
      Group IV, 14-17.11years. An equal number of male and female participants were
      assigned to each group. The PENTAX Medical PAS Model 6600 was used. Descriptive
      statistics for 56 parameters across six protocols were expressed as mean,
      standard deviation, and range values. Each protocol was analyzed for age, gender,
      and age-gender interaction. RESULTS: Age was the most predominant factor,
      affecting 37 of the 56 aerodynamic parameters investigated. Gender and age-gender
      factors were observed at an equal frequency, each affecting 16 parameters.
      Pitch-related parameters were the most altered parameters in each protocol.
      Age-gender interaction was observed in parameters related to the expiratory
      airflow. CONCLUSIONS: This study established the normative values of phonatoary
      aerodynamics for a large pediatric population with a wide age range and developed
      a normative database for healthy Turkish-speaking children. This is the first
      study to investigate running speech protocol in aerodynamic assessment.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to evaluate the presence of ghrelin and orexin in
      the testicular tissue of patients who have undergone microscopic testicular sperm
      extraction (micro-TESE) due to idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia. Seventy
      azoospermic cases were included in this study; serum hormone levels were measured
      and genetic investigations were performed. The patients were divided into two
      groups: micro-TESE (+) and micro-TESE (-). The number of Leydig cells and stained
      cells in the seminiferous tubules were counted under a light microscope, and we
      analyzed ghrelin and orexin activity. The relationship between serum hormone
      levels and ghrelin and orexin distributions in testicular tissue was evaluated
      according to micro-TESE results. While sperm was found in 33 cases (47.1%),
      micro-TESE was negative in 37 cases (52.9%). Peptide hormone activity in
      testicular tissue was higher in micro-TESE (+) cases. However, interstitial
      orexin (p = 0.038) and ghrelin (p = 0.002) activity showed statistically
      meaningful differences. Many different peptides, genes, and other unknown
      mechanisms play important roles in testicular function. In particular, the
      peptides orexin and ghrelin may play regulatory roles in testicular function in
      humans.

AB  - Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) is a rare, slow-growing, benign lesion of the
      cerebellum. It is often seen in the second and fourth decades. This disease is
      extremely rare in childhood. A 6-year-old girl presented with loss of balance. A 
      mass lesion in the right cerebellum was detected by magnetic resonance imaging.
      The patient underwent surgical removal of the lesion, and the histological
      diagnosis was dysplastic gangliocytoma (LDD). The patient was discharged without 
      complication, and her balance improved in the follow-up period. In this report,
      we present this rare occurrence in childhood and discuss the clinical course and 
      management. LDD is very rare in early childhood and should be considered in the
      differential diagnosis of posterior fossa lesions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Detection rate of thyroid nodules is increasing with the use of new
      imaging modalities, especially in screening for malignancies. Positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/ CT)-positive thyroid nodules should be
      differentiated for malignancy to avoid unnecessary operations and further
      follow-up. Most trials evaluate the role of SUVmax, but there is no definitive
      information about the utility of Hounsfield unit (HU) values for prediction of
      malignancy. This study aimed to evaluate the HU values beside SUVmax for
      detecting malignancy risk of PET/CT-positive thyroid nodules. SUBJECTS AND
      METHODS: Results of 98 cancer patients who had fine needle aspiration biopsy
      (FNAB) for thyroid nodules detected on PET/CT between January 2011 and December
      2015 were assessed. The FNABs and surgical pathological results were recorded.
      RESULTS: FNABs revealed benign results in 32 patients (32.7%), malignant in 18
      (18.4%), non-diagnostic in 20 (20.4%), and indeterminate in 28 (28.5%).
      Twenty-four patients underwent thyroidectomy. The mean HU values were not
      significantly different in benign and malignant nodules (p = 0.73). However, the 
      mean SUVmax was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in malignant ones. Area under
      curve (AUC) was 0.824 for SUVmax; the cut-off value was over 5.55 (p < 0.001),
      with 80% sensitivity, 84.5% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Our current study
      demonstrated that HU value does not add any additional valuable information for
      discriminating between malignant and benign thyroid nodules. We also defined a
      SUV cut-off value of 5.55 for malignant potential of thyroid nodules detected on 
      PET/CT Arch Endocrinol Metab. 2018;62(4):460-5.

AB  - Cholestasis is a condition wherein bile flow is interrupted and lithocholic acid 
      is known to play a key role in causing severe liver injury. In this study, we
      performed in-depth analysis of the morphological changes in bile canaliculi and
      the biological role of villin in cholestasis using lithocholic acid-stimulated
      HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells. We confirmed disruption of the bile canaliculi
      in liver sections from a liver allograft patient with cholestasis. Lithocholic
      acid caused strong cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells, which was associated with
      abnormal morphology. Lithocholic acid reduced villin expression, which recovered 
      in the presence of nuclear receptor agonists. Furthermore, villin mRNA expression
      increased following small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of the
      nuclear farnesoid X receptor and pregnane X receptor. Villin knockdown using
      siRNA caused cell growth arrest in HepG2 cells. The effect of villin-knockdown on
      whole-genome expression in HepG2 cells was analyzed by DNA microarray. Our data
      suggest that lithocholic acid caused cell growth arrest by suppressing villin
      expression via farnesoid X receptor and pregnane X receptor in HepG2 cells.

AB  - Periostin is an extracellular matrix protein from the fasciclin family that
      guides cellular trafficking and extracellular matrix organization. Periostin
      stimulates mature cardiomyocytes to reenter the cell cycle. The molecular
      mechanism behind such stimulation remains to be explored. A DNA microarray
      technology constituting 30,429 gene-level probe sets was utilized to investigate 
      effects of recombinant murine periostin peptide on the gene expression pattern in
      a rat model of isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial injury. The experiment was 
      performed on 84 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats in four groups ( n = 21): (1)
      control group, (2) only periostin applied group, (3) ISO cardiotoxicity group,
      and (4) ISO + periostin group. The experiment was continued for 28 days, and rats
      were killed on days 1, 7, and 28 ( n = 7). Microarray analyses revealed that
      periostin significantly altered the expression of at least +/-2-fold of 2474
      genes in the ISO + periostin group compared to the ISO cardiotoxicity group of
      which 521 genes altered out of 30,429 gene-level probe sets. Ingenuity pathway
      analysis indicated that multiple pathway networks were affected by periostin,
      with predominant changes occurring in the expression of genes involved in
      oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, fatty acid metabolism, and TNF-alpha
      NF-kappaB signaling pathways. These findings indicate that periostin alters gene 
      expression profile in the ISO-induced myocardial injury and modulates local
      myocardial inflammation, possibly mitigating inflammation through TNF-alpha
      NF-kappaB signaling pathway along with a decreased Casp7 activity and apoptotic
      cell death.

AB  - Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma is a rare lymphoma specific to the
      gastrointestinal system, arising from intraepithelial T lymphocytes, that is
      often associated with celiac disease. We report a 53-year-old female patient with
      no previous disease who presented with severe abdominal pain. Physical
      examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness and abdominal guarding and the 
      patient underwent emergency surgery with a diagnosis of acute abdomen. During the
      operation, a 20-cm mass was found located on Treitz ligament, invading the
      duodenum and pancreatic head and perforating the jejunum. Histologically,
      medium-sized monomorphic atypical lymphocyte infiltration with dark nucleus and
      narrow cytoplasm was seen in the layers of mucosa, submucosa, muscular wall, and 
      serosa of the duodenum. The final pathological diagnosis was
      "enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma type 2" based on immunohistochemical and 
      serological findings. Based on the World Health Organization 2008 criteria,
      enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma has two subtypes. Type 1
      enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma is associated with celiac disease and has 
      HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 genotype. Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma 2
      enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma seldom occurs and is not associated with
      celiac disease.

AB  - Malignant insulinomas are infrequent endocrine tumors with miscellaneous clinical
      courses. In this report, we present a rare case of insulinoma that recurred with 
      solitary hepatic metastasis 15 years after the initial resection of the primary
      tumor from the pancreas. A 20-year-old woman first presented with the symptoms of
      hypoglycemia in 1996. The diagnosis of pancreatic insulinoma was confirmed by
      laboratory findings, and the initial surgery had been performed involving
      complete enucleation of the pancreatic mass. Histopathologically, the tumor was
      diagnosed as a benign adenoma. After 15 years, the patient experienced symptoms
      of hypoglycemia again, and laboratory findings and abdominal computed tomography 
      identified a lesion in the liver. Intraoperative ultrasound did not show any
      lesion in the pancreas, and wedge resection was performed for the hepatic lesion.
      Postoperative blood glucose levels returned to normal. Histopathologic
      examination confirmed the diagnosis of liver metastasis of a neuroendocrine
      tumor. This is the longest interval between primary tumor and the metastasis
      reported in the literature, for insulinoma. Thus, it should be remembered that
      long-term follow-up is mandatory for the patients with insulinoma even after
      resection of the primary tumor. Resection is recommended when a metastatic lesion
      is observed.

AB  - Skin metastasis originating from colorectal cancer is a rare entity and usually
      signifies poor prognosis. We present a case of a 62-year-old male patient who
      presented with a cutaneous metastatic focus on his forehead after five years of
      the primary treatment of colon cancer. Complete response from the cutaneous
      metastasis nodule was achieved with radiotherapy. The patient is still alive and 
      under a second-line palliative chemotherapy regimen because of the multiple liver
      metastases. It is important for physicians to be aware of skin metastasis in
      patients with an oncology history.

AB  - Goblet cell carcinoid tumor of the appendix is an uncommon neoplasia that shares 
      the histological attributes of both adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumors. Its
      prognosis has a more aggressive course than the other known carcinoid tumors.
      Clinical diagnosis of goblet cell carcinoid is seldom made preoperatively. The
      most common clinical presentation of goblet cell carcinoid tumor is acute
      appendicitis. In this study, we report a patient on whom right hemicolectomy was 
      performed because of a cacal sessile polyp with high grade dysplasia; goblet cell
      carcinoid tumor of the appendix was revealed incidentally during microscopic
      evaluation of the appendectomy specimen. The patient healed uneventfully and no
      recurrence was observed after the 12-month follow-up period. Careful microscopic 
      examination of the appendectomy specimen is key for the diagnosis of appendiceal 
      tumors such as goblet cell carcinoid, especially in elderly patients.

AB  - Extragastrointestinal stromal tumors that arise in the pancreas are extremely
      rare and managing them can be difficult, particularly if located in the head of
      pancreas. This case report aims to contribute to the existing data in the
      literature regarding extragastrointestinal stromal tumors with rare and unusual
      locations. We present a 56-year-old man who presented with recurrent mild right
      upper quadrant abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography and magnetic
      resonance imaging revealed a mass lesion with a diameter of 10 cm localized in
      the head of pancreas. Pancreaticoduodenectomy with complete tumor excision was
      performed. He was discharged on the postoperative day 14. Only 15
      extragastrointestinal stromal tumors cases have been reported. Of these 15 cases,
      tumors were located in the head of pancreas in six cases. Here we report the
      seventh case of pancreatic extragastrointestinal stromal tumor arising in the
      head of pancreas and also the largest of these seven tumors.

TI  - Postmortem Diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction Due to Butane Gas Intoxication in a
      Child: A Case Report.
LID - 10.1097/PAF.0000000000000435 [doi]
AB  - Volatile substance addiction and toxic gas inhalation are now an important health
      problem. The pleasure-based inhalation of butane gas, also known as lighter
      refill gas, is especially prevalent among children and young people. The most
      important reasons for this situation are that they are cheap and easy to obtain
      and lack of legal supervision. The exhaled gas is absorbed through the alveolar
      surface and rapidly enters the bloodstream and leads to clinical signs. It can
      cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, hallucinations, and euphoria in the
      acute phase. In severe cases, bronchospasm, hypoxia, ventricular arrhythmia,
      cardiopulmonary arrest, and death can occur. Our case is one of the rare cases in
      the literature that was diagnosed by postmortem histopathological examination.
      Our case is a 15-year-old girl who was found in front of a tobacco product store.
      On gross examination, there was a hemorrhagic area under the aortic valve that
      continued to interventricular septum. There was no coronary artery lesion.
      Histopathological examination revealed hypereosinophilia and contraction band
      necrosis in myocardial fibers, which was more intense in papillary muscle.
      Immunohistochemical studies also supported early myocardial ischemic changes.
      Upon toxicological examination, butane gas was detected in lung and blood
      samples.

TI  - Effect of anakinra, an interleukin one beta antagonist, on oxidative testicular
      damage induced in rats with ischemia reperfusion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been reported in the literature that proinflammatory
      interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) is increased in cases of testicular ischemia
      reperfusion (I/R) damage. This information suggests that anakinra, an IL-1beta
      antagonist, may be effective in testicular I/R damage. OBJECTIVE: In our study,
      we investigated the effect of anakinra on testicular I/R damage induced in rats
      with torsion/detorsion. METHODS: The 50mg/kg anakinra+testicular
      torsion/detorsion (KTD-50) and 100mg/kg anakinra+testicular torsion/detorsion
      (KTD-100) groups received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 50mg/kg and
      100mg/kg of anakinra, respectively. In turn, the testicular torsion/detorsion
      (TTD) and sham operation (SOG) groups received a single dose of distilled water
      as a solvent 1h before ketamine anaesthesia. After the testes of the TTD, KTD-50 
      and KTD-100 groups were subjected to torsion and detorsion for 4h each, the rats 
      were killed with a high-dose anaesthesia, and their testicles were removed and
      evaluated through biochemical, gene expression and histopathological
      examinations. The results were evaluated in comparison with those of the SOG
      group. RESULTS: The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and
      IL-1beta showed significant increases in the TTD group, which underwent
      torsion/detorsion, compared to the KTD-50, KTD-100 and SOG groups. Conversely,
      the levels of glutathione (tGSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPO) and glutathione
      s-transferase (GST) were found to be significantly higher in the KTD-50, KTD-100 
      and SOG groups than in the TTD group. CONCLUSION: Anakinra at a 100mg/kg dose
      histologically suppressed better oxidative stress and tunica albuginea, germ
      cell, seminiferous tubule and interstitial damage in the testicular tissue
      compared to a 50mg/kg dose. Experimental results indicate that anakinra might be 
      beneficial in the attenuation of testicular I/R damage.

TI  - Utility of FDG PET/CT in the Characterization of Sinonasal Neoplasms: Analysis of
      Standardized Uptake Value Parameters.
PG  - 1354-1360
LID - 10.2214/AJR.18.19501 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the contribution of different standardized uptake
      value (SUV) parameters generated from pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT in the
      characterization of sinonasal neoplasms with histopathologic correlations.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 97 consecutive patients 
      (58 men, 39 women; age range, 20-93 years; mean age, 62 years) with
      pathologically proven untreated sinonasal neoplasms who underwent FDG PET/CT from
      February 2010 to August 2017. Semiquantitative analysis of primary tumors were
      performed to evaluate the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean
      standardized uptake value (SUVmean), and the ratio of the SUVmax of the primary
      tumor to the SUVmean of mediastinal blood pool, which we refer to here as "
      SUVratio." Various sinonasal tumor histopathologic subgroups (n = 14) were
      analyzed. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the SUVmax, SUVmean, and
      SUVratio with the histopathologic diagnosis. RESULTS: Mean values of SUVmax,
      SUVmean, and SUVratio for the sinonasal neoplasms were 16.6 +/- 9.7 (SD), 8.6 +/-
      5.1, and 5.9 +/- 3.7, respectively, and each parameter was significantly
      different between histopathologic types (p < 0.05). Mean values of SUVmax,
      SUVmean, and SUVratio were higher in sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) 
      than in olfactory neuroblastoma, metastasis, and adenoid cystic carcinoma (p <
      0.05). Mean values of SUVmax and SUVmean were higher in squamous cell carcinoma
      (SCC) than in olfactory neuroblastoma and metastasis (p < 0.05). Also, mean
      SUVmax was higher in SCC and SNUC than in poorly differentiated carcinoma (p <
      0.05). Mean SUVratio was higher in SCC than in small cell carcinoma, olfactory
      neuroblastoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude
      that different SUV parameters from FDG PET/CT can be used as so-called "metabolic
      biopsy" to categorize sinonasal neoplasms into different histopathologic
      subgroups because it can help in the characterization of some of the more common 
      subgroups of sinonasal neoplasms. However, we found that there is overlap in FDG 
      uptake values among some of the rare histologic subgroups; hence, surgical biopsy
      is still needed for differentiation of histologic subtypes of aggressive
      sinonasal masses.

      Anterior Mediastinum With Literature Review.
LID - 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001327 [doi]
AB  - Burkitt lymphoma manifesting as an intracardiac mass is a rare entity. This
      report describes the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with an intracardiac
      mass and tumor thrombosis in the anterior mediastinum that proved to be Burkitt
      lymphoma. The LMB-96 chemotherapy protocol was given and at the end of the
      treatment there was still residual mass. A biopsy was performed and the pathology
      revealed thymus tissue. The patient has been in complete remission for 3 months. 
      Burkitt lymphoma has a short doubling time and an intracardiac lesion can become 
      life threatening. Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial in achieving
      optimal outcomes.

      experimental animal study with radiological outcomes.
PG  - 2309499018802491
LID - 10.1177/2309499018802491 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze the immunohistochemical effect of
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on healing of long-bone fractures in terms of bone
      morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the
      Ki-67 proliferation index, and radiological and histological analyses. METHODS:
      Sixteen adult rabbits, whose right femoral diaphysis was fractured and fixed with
      Kirschner wires, were randomly divided into two groups, control and PRP (groups A
      and B, respectively). PRP was given to group B at 1 week postoperatively, and all
      animals were euthanized after 12 weeks. Radiographic evaluations were performed
      periodically. Cortical callus formation, chondroid and woven bone area
      percentages, osteoblastic and fibroblastic activities, and mature bone formation 
      were examined. The depths of BMP-2 and VEGF staining were measured. The Ki-67
      proliferation index was also calculated. RESULTS: The mean radiological union
      score of group B was significantly higher than that of group A. There were also
      statistically significant differences between groups A and B in terms of cortical
      callus formation, woven bone area percentage, fibroblast proliferation, and
      mature bone formation. Group B had significantly more cortical callus and mature 
      bone formation with less woven bone and fibroblast proliferation.
      Immunohistochemical analysis revealed no statistically significant difference
      between the groups in terms of BMP-2 and VEGF staining and the Ki-67 index.
      CONCLUSIONS: PRP had no effect on BMP-2 or VEGF levels with no increase in the
      Ki-67 proliferation index, although its application had a positive effect on bone
      healing by increasing callus and mature bone formation with decreased woven bone 
      and fibroblast proliferation.

TI  - RNA-based markers in biopsy cores with atypical small acinar proliferation:
      Predictive effect of T2E fusion positivity and MMP-2 upregulation for a
      subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis.
LID - 10.1002/pros.23724 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) is a precursor lesion of
      prostate cancer (PC), and PC develops from this suspicious focus or an unsampled 
      malignant gland nearby. However, PC-related molecular alterations that could
      guide the timing of repeat biopsies and help monitor PC risk in ASAP-diagnosed
      patients have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to first
      investigate the expression of seven different PC-related RNAs that included
      serine 2 (TMPRSS2): erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) gene
      (TMPRSS2-ERG, T2E) fusion, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), kallikrein
      related peptidase 3 (KLK3), androgen receptor (AR), prostate cancer specific
      antigen 3 (PCA3), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and 9. METHODS:
      PC-related RNAs were evaluated using a real-time quantitative reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) system in pathologically
      ASAP-diagnosed prostate biopsy cores from 55 patients presenting with a normal
      digital rectal examination and a PSA level of 4-10 ng/mL. RESULTS: We detected
      that positive T2E fusion status (P = 0.013) and the expression of AMACR (P =
      0.016), AR (P = 0.016) and MMP-2 (P = 0.013) were independently and significantly
      associated with PC risk in ASAP patients. There were also several statistically
      significant correlations between expression levels. Additionally, we demonstrated
      that T2E fusion positive ASAP patients with higher MMP-2 expression were more
      likely to be diagnosed with PC at a subsequent biopsy during the follow-up period
      (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Although, more clinical validations are needed for the 
      stratification of PC risk in ASAP-diagnosed biopsy cores, our current results
      indicate that the coexistence of T2E fusion positivity with MMP-2 upregulation
      may help clinicians adjust their biopsy timetable and/or assessment of PC risk in
      ASAP-diagnosed patients with a PSA level of 4-10 ng/mL.

TI  - Clinical significance of mesangial IgM deposition in patients with IgA
      nephropathy.
LID - 10.1007/s10157-018-1651-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glomerular immunoglobulin G deposition in patients with
      immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) has been shown to be associated with adverse 
      renal outcomes. Clinical significance of mesangial immunoglobulin M (IgM)
      deposition in these patients remains to be proven. METHODS: One hundred patients 
      who had a diagnosis of IgAN between 2001 and 2017 were enrolled. Patients were
      divided into two groups based on mesangial IgM deposition status. Groups were
      compared for demographic, clinical, and pathologic variables at baseline and in
      follow-up. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of
      mesangial IgM positivity on renal survival. RESULTS: IgM-positive group included 
      51% of participants. Baseline demographic and clinical parameters were not
      significantly different between groups. Mesangial IgM deposition was
      significantly associated with a higher segmental sclerosis score (p = 0.008). At 
      last visit, median serum creatinine was higher (p = 0.021) and eGFR was lower (p 
      = 0.006) in IgM-positive group. Nineteen (19%) of all patients reached the
      combined primary outcome which includes doubling in serum creatinine or evolution
      to ESRD. Cumulative renal survival was lower (p = 0.001) and resistant disease
      was more frequent in IgM-positive group (p = 0.026). Renal survival at 15 years
      was 94.2% and 59.7% in IgM-negative and IgM-positive groups, respectively (p =
      0.006). Time-averaged proteinuria (HR 2.9; 95% CI 1.9-4.5; p < 0.001) and
      mesangial IgM deposition (HR, 13.2; 95% CI 1.9-93.1; p = 0.01) were found to be
      independent predictors of unfavorable renal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion,
      we demonstrated that mesangial IgM deposition independently associated with worse
      renal outcomes in patients with IgA nephropathy.

TI  - Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1alpha and AT-Rich Interactive Domain-Containing Protein
      1A Expression in Pituitary Adenomas: Association with Pathological, Clinical, and
      Radiological Features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) plays a major role in tumorigenesis
      and cancer progression. In hypoxic conditions, HIF is upregulated and has been
      shown to activate multiple genes required for cells to adapt to hypoxia. AT-rich 
      interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), a SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose
      nonfermentable) chromatin remodeling gene has context-dependent tumor-suppressive
      and oncogenic roles in cancer. We assessed the correlations between the
      expression and mutations of HIF1A and ARID1A in histopathologically confirmed
      pituitary adenomas. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 71 patients
      who had undergone surgery for pituitary adenoma. Patient demographic,
      radiological, and histopathological features were correlated with HIF1A and
      ARID1A expression. RESULTS: Most cases were HIF1A positive (62%). No significant 
      correlation was found between HIF1A expression and age, gender, tumor size, bone 
      erosion, hemorrhage, or Ki-67 index. An inverse correlation was demonstrated
      between HIF1A and cavernous sinus invasion (P = 0.035). ARID1A loss was found in 
      28.2% of pituitary adenomas. No significant correlation was found between ARID1A 
      and any of the assessed variables. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient cohort, we found
      that most pituitary adenomas expressed HIF1A. To the best of our knowledge, we
      are the first to assess the presence of ARID1A loss in pituitary adenomas, which 
      occurred in 28.2% of cases. No individual demographic, imaging, or
      histopathological feature was predictive of ARID1A. Likewise, with the exception 
      of an increased incidence of cavernous sinus invasion, no correlation was found
      with HIF1A. Given the prognostic value of these markers in other malignancies,
      their frequency in pituitary adenomas warrants further exploration of their
      potential role in pituitary adenoma treatment and outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop externally validated, reproducible, and generalizable
      models for distinguishing three major subtypes of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs)
      using machine learning-based quantitative computed tomography (CT) texture
      analysis (qCT-TA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-eight RCCs were included in this 
      retrospective study for model development and internal validation. Another 26
      RCCs were included from public databases (The Cancer Genome Atlas-TCGA) for
      independent external validation. Following image preparation steps
      (reconstruction, resampling, normalization, and discretization), 275 texture
      features were extracted from unenhanced and corticomedullary phase CT images.
      Feature selection was firstly done with reproducibility analysis by three
      radiologists, and; then, with a wrapper-based classifier-specific algorithm. A
      nested cross-validation was performed for feature selection and model
      optimization. Base classifiers were the artificial neural network (ANN) and
      support vector machine (SVM). Base classifiers were also combined with three
      additional algorithms to improve generalizability performance. Classifications
      were done with the following groups: (i), non-clear cell RCC (non-cc-RCC) versus 
      clear cell RCC (cc-RCC) and (ii), cc-RCC versus papillary cell RCC (pc-RCC)
      versus chromophobe cell RCC (chc-RCC). Main performance metric for comparisons
      was the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). RESULTS: Number of the
      reproducible features is smaller for the unenhanced images (93 out of 275)
      compared to the corticomedullary phase images (232 out of 275). Overall
      performance metrics of the machine learning-based qCT-TA derived from
      corticomedullary phase images were better than those of unenhanced images. Using 
      corticomedullary phase images, ANN with adaptive boosting algorithm performed
      best for discrimination of non-cc-RCCs from cc-RCCs (MCC = 0.728) with an
      external validation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 84.6%, 69.2%, and
      100%, respectively. On the other hand, the performance of the machine
      learning-based qCT-TA is rather poor for distinguishing three major subtypes. The
      SVM with bagging algorithm performed best for discrimination of pc-RCC from other
      RCC subtypes (MCC = 0.804) with an external validation accuracy, sensitivity, and
      specificity of 69.2%, 71.4%, and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Machine
      learning-based qCT-TA can distinguish non-cc-RCCs from cc-RCCs with a satisfying 
      performance. On the other hand, the performance of the method for distinguishing 
      three major subtypes is rather poor. Corticomedullary phase CT images provide
      much more valuable texture parameters than unenhanced images.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cell responses and apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis)
      represent critical arms of the inflammation resolution response. We sought to
      determine whether these processes might be linked through Treg-cell-mediated
      enhancement of efferocytosis. In zymosan-induced peritonitis and
      lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury, Treg cells increased early in resolution,
      and Treg cell depletion decreased efferocytosis. In advanced atherosclerosis,
      where defective efferocytosis drives disease progression, Treg cell expansion
      improved efferocytosis. Mechanistic studies revealed the following sequence: (1) 
      Treg cells secreted interleukin-13 (IL-13), which stimulated IL-10 production in 
      macrophages; (2) autocrine-paracrine signaling by IL-10 induced Vav1 in
      macrophages; and (3) Vav1 activated Rac1 to promote apoptotic cell engulfment. In
      summary, Treg cells promote macrophage efferocytosis during inflammation
      resolution via a transcellular signaling pathway that enhances apoptotic cell
      internalization. These findings suggest an expanded role of Treg cells in
      inflammation resolution and provide a mechanistic basis for Treg-cell-enhancement
      strategies for non-resolving inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Does it take three to tango? An unsuspected multimorbidity of CD8(+) T cell
      lymphoproliferative disorder, malaria, and EBV infection.
PG  - 349
LID - 10.1186/s12936-018-2497-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is known to cause acute and deadly complications. However,
      malaria can cause unforeseen pathologies due to its chronicity. It increases the 
      risk of endemic Burkitt Lymphoma development by inducing DNA damage in germinal
      centre (GC) B cells, and leading higher frequency of Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV)-infected cells in GCs. EBV is well known for its tropism for B cells.
      However, less is known about EBV's interaction with T cells and its association
      with T cell lymphoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old Sudanese male admitted to 
      hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, a non-endemic country, with hyperpigmented painful 
      skin rashes on his whole body. A complete blood count and a peripheral blood
      smear during admission revealed large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) with abnormally
      higher CD8 T cell numbers. Additional skin biopsy and pathology results were
      compatible with CD8(+) T cell lymphoproliferative disorder with skin involvement.
      Patient was treated and discharged. However, a pathologist noticed unusual
      structures in skin tissue samples. Careful evaluation of skin biopsy samples by
      polarized microscopy revealed birefringent crystalloid structures resembling
      malarial haemozoin mainly loaded in macrophages and giant histiocytes. After
      purification of DNA from the skin biopsy samples, nested PCR was performed for
      the detection of Plasmodium parasites and Plasmodium falciparum DNA was
      amplified. Because, the co-presence of EBV infection with malaria is a well-known
      aetiology of lymphoma, EBV-early RNA (EBER) transcripts were investigated in
      paraffin-embedded tissue samples and found to be positive in macrophage-like
      histiocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This is a unique case of malaria and EBV infection in a
      T-LGL lymphoma patient who presented in a non-endemic country. This case
      emphasizes the clinical importance of EBV monitoring in T-LGL patients with skin 
      involvement. Notably, Plasmodium infection should be examined in patients from
      malaria endemic regions by pathological and molecular investigations.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between irritable 
      bowel syndrome (IBS) and plasma and tissue ghrelin levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Patients who had undergone gastroscopy procedure for any reason previously were
      enrolled in the study. Among these, patients with IBS symptoms were evaluated
      according to the Roma III criteria. The healthy control group comprised patients 
      with no IBS symptom and had undergone gastroscopy procedure for another reason.
      The plasma ghrelin level and tissue ghrelin level obtained by immunohistochemical
      examination of biopsy specimens taken from the gastric antrum and corpus were
      evaluated in all participants. RESULTS: The mean age of 90 participants was
      43.64}12.64 years. The median value of the plasma ghrelin level was 3.29
      (1.2-12.7) in the diarrhea group (IBS-D), 1.49 (0.82-7.08) in the constipation
      group (IBS-C), and 1.5 (0.2-3.7) in the control group. The plasma ghrelin levels 
      between the groups were found to be significantly higher in IBS-D than in IBS-C
      and the control groups (p=0.001 and p=0.001, respectively). On comparing antral
      mucosal gland biopsy outcomes among the groups, staining intensity score was
      found to be significantly high in IBS-C as compared with the control group,
      whereas no significant difference was observed between IBS-D and the control
      groups (p=0.020 and p=0.429, respectively). CONCLUSION: The plasma ghrelin level 
      in IBS-D and the staining intensity in the antral mucosal gland in IBS-C were
      found to be significantly higher. In addition, there was no difference between
      the groups in terms of ghrelin staining intensity in the gastric corpus.

TI  - An evaluation of the effect on lower extremity fracture healing of collagen-based
      fusion material containing 2 different calcium phosphate salts: An experimental
      rat model.
PG  - 1295-1301
LID - 10.17219/acem/90766 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Collagen-based synthetic bone grafts which contain tricalcium
      phosphate (TCP) and hydroxyapatite (HA), and collagen-based synthetic bone grafts
      containing only TCP have some advantages compared to autografts. Therefore, these
      grafts are frequently used to fill bone defects and pseudoarthrosis. OBJECTIVES: 
      The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical, radiological and 
      histopathological effects of TCP-HA and TCP alone + Type-1 collagen in healing
      lower extremity fractures in a pseudoarthrosis model in rat femurs. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: A total of 36 female Wistar rats were randomly separated into 4 groups. 
      Group 1 (n = 10) was the control group. A femur pseudoarthrosis model was created
      in Groups 2, 3 and 4. On the 90th day after the 1st surgery in Group 2 (n = 10), 
      TCP-HA + Type-1 collagen was applied, in Group 3 (n = 10), TCP alone + type-1
      collagen was applied, and in Group 4 (n = 6, the placebo group), saline solution 
      was applied. Fixation was performed with an intramedullar pin. After 60 days and 
      clinical and radiological scoring, all animals were sacrificed and a
      histopathological evaluation of the pseudoarthrosis areas was conducted. RESULTS:
      In all the clinical, radiological and histopathological measurements used in the 
      evaluations of the differences between the groups, a higher rate of union was
      determined in Group 2 (TCP-HA). No significant difference was determined between 
      Group 3 and Group 4 in terms of union rates. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical,
      radiological and histopathological results of this study showed that TCP alone
      was less effective than TCP-HA in the union of a femur pseudoarthrosis model in
      rats. The reason for this difference was considered to be hydroxyapatite (HA).

PG  - 218-224
LID - 10.5152/ejbh.2018.4038 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The prognostic importance of extracapsular extension (ECE) in breast
      cancer is not yet clear, especially in patients with pathological T1-2 and N1
      (pT1-2N1) disease. We aimed to investigate whether the extent of ECE was an
      independent prognostic factor for survival outcomes in patients with pT1-2N1
      breast cancer. Materials and Methods: A total number of 131 patients with pT1-2N1
      breast cancer treated between 2009 and 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. A
      single pathologist re-analyzed the histologic examples of all cases. The extent
      of ECE was graded from 0 to 4. Results: There was a significant correlation
      between the number of lymph nodes involved and ECE grade (p=0.004). According to 
      the univariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and ECE grade were the
      significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS); age, number of
      metastatic lymph nodes, menopausal status, and ECE grade were the prognostic
      factors for disease-free survival (DFS). With a median follow-up of 46 months,
      grade 3-4 ECE seems to be notably associated with a shorter OS and DFS in
      multivariate analysis. The mean OS was 85 months for the patients with grade 0-2 
      ECE vs 75 months for the patients with grade 3-4 ECE (p=0.003). The mean DFS was 
      83 months for the patients with grade 0-3 ECE vs 68 months for the patients with 
      grade 4 ECE (p=<0.0001). Conclusion: This research has shown that the extent of
      ECE is an important prognostic factor for survival in pT1-2N1 breast cancer
      patients and grade 3-4 ECE seems to be notably associated with a shorter OS and
      DFS.

TI  - A clinical compilation of lymph node pathologies comparing the diagnostic
      performance of biopsy methods.
LID - 10.1007/s40477-018-0321-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: It is critical to obtain sufficient tissue, both in quality and
      quantity, in biopsy applications for histopathological review. Our aim was to
      compare fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and core needle biopsy (CNB)
      techniques in terms of their diagnostic performance in lymph node biopsies. This 
      was a clinical compilation, and histopathological results from biopsies were also
      evaluated. METHODS: A total of 242 patients and 246 lymph nodes were
      prospectively evaluated. All histopathologic specimens were obtained through
      ultrasonography-guided biopsies performed at our institute between April 2015 and
      October 2017. Histopathological results were grouped according to diagnostic
      performance, and the mean performance scores of the two methods were compared.
      RESULTS: For FNAC, the mean diagnostic score was calculated to be 1.63, whereas
      for CNB, the mean diagnostic score was calculated to be 1.89. The difference
      between diagnostic scores of the two techniques was statistically significant (p 
      < 0.01). CONCLUSION: We recommend that interventional radiologists perform
      vacuum-assisted biopsies if there are no financial hindrances or evidence of
      psychological issues in patients. We recommend this not only for lymph nodes of
      malignant appearance but also for those that appear benign.

AB  - Oligodendrogliomas (ODGs) is a diffuse glial tumor that constitutes 4.2% of all
      brain tumors. Extraneural metastases, sometimes seen in glioblastoma multiforme, 
      are extremely rare in ODG. In this report, we present a 63-year-old male patient 
      who was diagnosed with Grade 3 ODG and had an intracranial mass resected in our
      clinic 4 years ago. The subject now presented with low back pain and was found to
      have widespread metastases. The prolongation of patient survival by current
      treatment regimens has revealed a growing number of ODG patients with metastases.
      We believe that back pain complaints in patients with ODG should be viewed as an 
      indicator of metastasis.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of different doses of systemic
      melatonin application on new bone formation during mandibular distraction
      osteogenesis (DO) in rats. Mandibular DO was performed on 30 adult female
      Sprague-Dawley rats, which were randomly divided into three groups: control group
      (CNT), melatonin dose 1 (MLT-D1), and melatonin dose 2 (MLT-D2). A five-day
      latent waiting period and a ten-day distraction phase followed the surgery. After
      the surgery, rats from the MLT-D1 and MLT-D2 groups received 25 and 50 mg/kg
      melatonin, respectively, at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. The animals were
      euthanised 28 days after distraction, i.e. at 43 days after surgery. Histological
      and histomorphometric analyses revealed that the distracted bone area was
      completely filled with new bone formation in all three groups. The MLT-D2 group
      exhibited the most new bone formation, followed by MLT-D1 and CNT. The melatonin 
      groups had more osteoclasts than the CNT (p < 0.05). The number of osteoblasts
      was higher in the melatonin groups than in the CNT group, and the MLT-D2 had more
      osteoclasts than the MLT-D1 group (p < 0.05). Finally, the osteopontin (OPN) and 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were higher in the melatonin
      groups than in the CNT group, and the MLT-D2 had higher OPN and VEGF levels than 
      the MLT-D1 (p < 0.05). This study suggests that systemic melatonin application
      could increase new bone formation in DO.

AB  - Gorham-Stout disease is a rare bone resorption disease, the etiology and
      prognosis of which is uncertain but it is thought to be benign. It can involve
      one or more bones and can cause pain, swelling, deformity and fractures in
      affected bones. Diagnosis is made with a combination of clinical, radiological
      and histopathological examinations once other causes of osteolysis have been
      excluded. Due to its rarity, there is no standard therapeutic approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Capsule fibrosis is the most important and annoying complication of
      breast implant surgery. Radiotherapy (RT) used in the local treatment of breast
      cancer has an increasing effect on the existing fibrous capsule; this is called
      radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF). In this randomized controlled experimental
      study, we aim to investigate the reduction effect of superoxide dismutase (SOD)
      on RIF. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups, all of
      which were subjected to implant surgery. No additional procedures were done for
      the control group. The other groups were the SOD group, the RT + SOD group, and
      the RT group. The capsules were evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS: Although 
      SOD reduced surgery-induced capsule formation, it neither prevented nor reduced
      significantly RIF. CONCLUSIONS: In an experimental model that resembled breast
      cancer treatment, we concluded that SOD cannot reduce RIF but is effective in
      reducing capsular fibrosis around the silicone after implant surgery.

PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/15569527.2018.1530258 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine the effects of lycopene treatment in prevention of diabetes
      associated inflammatory response and oxidative stress in an experimental model.
      With this aim we investigated the levels of oxidative stress markers including
      Malondialdehyde (MDA), and total oxidative status (TOS)together with inflammatory
      markers including nuclear factor- kappa B (NFKB) and tumor necrosis factor alpha 
      (TNF-alpha) and antioxidants including total glutathione (TGSH), total oxidative 
      status (TOS) and total anti-oxidative status (TAS) levels on eye tissue. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: Totally 18 albino Wistar male rats (250-280 grams) assigned into
      three groups, with six rats in each group as follows: healthy group (HG), control
      group (CG), and lycopene group (LG). The diabetes was induced with alloxan
      administration in rats of CG and LG. Lycopene (4 mg/kg) was administered to the
      rats in LG once a day for 3 months. At the end of this period, the animals were
      sacrificed and their eyes were enucleated for histopathological evaluations. From
      the tissues, MDA, GSH, TOS, TAS, TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB levels were analyzed.
      RESULTS: MDA, TOS, OSI, NFKB and TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher,
      while TGSH and TAS levels were significantly lower in CG compared with HG (p <
      0.001). On the other hand in LG; MDA, TOS, OSI, NFKB and TNF-alpha levels were
      significantly lower, while TGSH and TAS levels were significantly higher compared
      with CG (p < 0.001). Regarding histopathological findings, although there was
      severe damage on optic nerve of rats in CG; there was only a slight damage in
      lycopene administered group. CONCLUSION: For the first time in literature we
      determined that, lycopene was significantly effective in prevention of augmented 
      inflammation and oxidative stress on eye tissue associated with diabetes, as well
      as the tissue damage on optic nerve. However, studies investigating the long-term
      clinical effects of lycopene on diabetic individuals are warranted.

PG  - e13145
LID - 10.1111/and.13145 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted on 28 male Wistar albino rats to determine the effects
      of chrysin on methotrexate-induced damage to testicular tissue. Rats were grouped
      into four groups of seven rats reach: Group 1 (n = 7) was the control group to
      which no drugs were administered; this group was only provided with food and
      water. Group 2 (n = 7) was administered 20 mg/kg of methotrexate once
      intraperitoneally. Group 3 (n = 7) was administered 50 mg/kg of chrysin for 7
      days orally. Group 4 (n = 7) was administered 20 mg/kg of methotrexate once
      intraperitoneally, followed by oral administration of 50 mg/kg of chrysin for 7
      days. At the end of the experiment, rats were anaesthetised, rat testes were
      removed, and spermatozoon was obtained from the cauda epididymis. It was
      determined that sperm count and motility, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide
      dismutase and catalase activities decreased in the methotrexate group, whereas
      malondialdehyde, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and nuclear
      kappa factor B expression levels increased. Furthermore, damage to tubulus
      seminiferus structures and affusion in germ cells was identified. In the
      methotrexate + chrysin administered group, sperm count improved, biochemical
      enzyme levels increased, and structural improvements were observed in testicular 
      tubules. These findings demonstrated that chrysin plays a protective role in
      testicular damage in rats.

TI  - Retrospective Multivariate Analysis of Data from Children with Suspected
      Appendicitis: A New Tool for Diagnosis.
PG  - 4810730
LID - 10.1155/2018/4810730 [doi]
AB  - Background: Decision-making for management may sometimes be difficult in acute
      appendicitis (AA). Various diagnostic scoring systems exist, but their
      sensitivity and specificity rates are far from ideal. In this study, the
      determination of the predictors and the effect of radiological data and
      developing a new scoring system were aimed. Methods: Medical records of patients 
      who were hospitalized for AA between February 2012 and October 2016 were
      retrospectively reviewed. All data were compared between patients with and
      without appendicitis. The multivariate analysis was performed to define
      significant variables and to examine the sensitivity and specificity of each
      group of predictors including radiological data. A new scoring system (NSS) was
      formed and was compared with two existing scoring systems: pediatric appendicitis
      score (PAS) and Alvarado scoring system (ASS) by using reclassification method.
      Results: Negative appendectomy rate was 11.3%. Statistical analysis identified 21
      independently significant variables. The heel drop test had the highest odds
      ratio. Sensitivity and specificity rates of clinical predictors were 84.6% and
      94.8%, respectively. Radiological predictors increased the sensitivity rate to
      86.9%. Sensitivity and specificity rates for PAS, ASS, and NSS were 86.8% and
      83.9%, 84.7% and 81.6%, and 96.8% and 95.6%, respectively. The "re-assessed
      negative appendectomy rate" was 6.2% and false positive results were remarkably
      more common in patients with duration of symptoms less than 24 hours. Conclusion:
      Radiological data improves the accuracy of diagnosis. Containing detailed
      clinical and radiological data, NSS performs superiorly to PAS and ASS, regarding
      sensitivity and specificity without any age limitation. The efficiency of NSS may
      be enhanced by determining different predictors for different phases of the
      inflammatory process.

TI  - Effects of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 on the kidney tissue of rats with ureteral
      obstruction.
PG  - 3061-3070
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S165695 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study was conducted since the effects of colloid solutions on the
      renal system remain controversial and need to be adequately studied in animals.
      We aimed to evaluate the effects of hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) on the kidney
      tissue of rats with late renal failure due to ureteral obstruction. Materials and
      methods: Rats were divided into four groups: Group C, control; Group HES,
      hydroxyethyl starch solution (HES) 130/0.4 (Voluven((R))); Group UUO, unilateral 
      ureteral obstruction (UUO); and Group UUO-HES, UUO-HES 130/0.4 (Voluven((R))). In
      the groups with ureteral obstruction, the distal part of the right ureter was
      accessed and sutured through a lower abdominal incision under ketamine
      anesthesia. Any signs of late-stage renal failure were evaluated after three
      weeks. Rats in the HES group and the renal failure-HES group were administered
      with HES 130/0.4 as a single intravenous dose of 20 mL/kg. After a follow-up of
      24 hours, intra-abdominal blood sample was collected, and the rats were
      sacrificed. Biochemical and histopathological parameters were then evaluated.
      Results: Ureteral obstruction significantly increased urea and creatinine levels.
      In addition, when the UUO-HES and HES groups were compared, the administration of
      HES increased urea and creatinine levels in the UUO-HES group. Nitric oxide
      enzyme activity and malondialdehyde levels have significantly increased in the
      UUO groups. In addition, HES significantly increased nitric oxide activity and
      malondialdehyde levels in the UUO-HES group, in comparison with the HES group.
      The activity of caspases 3 and 8 was significantly increased in the UUO groups.
      In addition, HES significantly increased the activity of caspases 3 and 8 in the 
      UUO-HES group, in comparison with the HES group. Light microscopy revealed
      significant changes in the UUO groups, especially in the obstructed kidneys.
      Conclusion: If indicated, HES should be used with caution in cases of UUO, but
      not in the cases of bilateral ureteral obstruction. Other aspects of these
      findings, including the clinical significance and practical applications, merit
      further experimental and clinical investigation.

TI  - DNA Repair Gene (XPD, XRCC4, and XRCC1) Polymorphisms in Patients with
      Endometrial Hyperplasia: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 146-150
LID - 10.12659/MSMBR.911041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between
      endometrial hyperplasia and DNA repair gene (XPD, XRCC4, and XRCC1)
      polymorphisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 114 cases enrolled in the study in
      4 groups: simple endometrial hyperplasia (SH) (Group 1), complex endometrial
      hyperplasia without atypia (CH) (Group 2), complex atypical endometrial
      hyperplasia (CAH) (Group 3), and normal endometrium (NE) (Group 4). Of these
      cases, 37 cases had SH, 36 cases had CH, 16 cases had CAH, and 25 cases had NE.
      To evaluate an association between atypia and DNA repair genes, we consider a
      group that included both SH and CH, the endometrial hyperplasia without atypia
      cases (Group 5). Genomic DNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded endometrial
      tissue collected from the Pathology Department of Gaziantep University Medical
      School. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or restriction fragment length
      polymorphism (RFLP) method was used for evaluating of XPD (-751), XRCC4 (-1394
      and a variable number of tandem repeats in intron 3), and XRCC1 (-399) genes.
      RESULTS We observed a notable distinction in patients having endometrial
      hyperplasia without atypia (the SH+CH group) and the CAH group in terms of XPD
      (-751) gene polymorphisms. A notable contrast was observed in patients with
      endometrial hyperplasia without atypia (the SH+CH group) and the NE group in
      terms of XRCC4 (VNTR intron 3) polymorphisms (P=0.026, P=0.018, respectively).
      CONCLUSIONS It was evident the DNA repair gene XPD and XRCC4 polymorphisms had a 
      role in the pathophysiology of endometrial hyperplasia.

TI  - Medical student education in transfusion medicine: Proposal from the "European
      and Mediterranean initiative in transfusion medicine".
LID - S1473-0502(18)30351-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.transci.2018.09.002 [doi]
AB  - A large body of observations indicate that there is an inconsistent knowledge of 
      Transfusion Medicine among health care professionals as well as inconsistent
      knowledge in all aspects of the transfusion process, from blood donation to
      transfusion on the ward. It is obvious to consider that appropriate education in 
      Transfusion Medicine should be achieved in the education of specialists who will 
      prescribe transfusion on a regular basis (hematologists, critical care
      specialists, anaethesiologists and others.) However,we also believe that
      education in Transfusion Medicine should also be delivered to almost all other
      medical specialists who may prescribe blood components. The variability in
      education of undergraduates in medical schools is universal most likely due to an
      absence of a predefined common platform. This paper, therefore, focuses on
      education at the undergraduate level and advocates coverage of the essential
      physiology and pathophysiology of blood as applied to blood transfusion as well
      as the medical and societal aspects of issues related to blood donation. It
      proposes incremental levels of training in Transfusion Medicine, with what is
      being therefore referred to as 'A', 'B', 'C' etc. curricula in ascending order of
      complexity; for example, 'A' and 'B' levels would involve medical, midwifery and 
      nursing students, covering a broad base of the subject: they will be detailed in 
      the present essay; ongoing further curricula will focus on physicians and other
      professionals working within the area or with responsibility for different
      aspects of the transfusion chain. It is intended that these courses include
      aspects of donor care, patient care and the appropriate use, safety and
      effectiveness of blood products. Next, it is advocated that curricula are
      addressed not only for high-income countries but also for middle- and low-income 
      ones.

TI  - Effects of Curcumin on Alveolar Bone Loss in Experimental Periodontitis in Rats: 
      A Morphometric and Histopathologic Study.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1024/0300-9831/a000243 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Curcumin is found in the rhizomes of the turmeric plant that has been
      showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the effects of systemic curcumin therapy on alveolar bone loss in an
      experimental periodontitis model in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-two male
      Wistar rats were randomly divided to 4 groups: 75 mg/kg/daily curcumin (C75; n
      =8), 150 mg/kg/daily curcumin (C150; n =8), Control (n =8), and Ligated (n =8).
      Curcumin was administrated using gastric gavage. After 12 days, the rats were
      sacrificed. Right mandibles samples were histopathologically examined. Alveolar
      bone loss was measured. Interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin 10 (IL-10)
      were evaluated in the serum samples and gingival homogenates. RESULTS: The
      measurements of alveolar bone loss in the mandibular molars revealed
      significantly higher bone-loss values in the Ligated group than the Control, C75 
      and C150 groups. The IL-1beta levels in the gingival homogenates were
      significantly increased in the Ligated group compared to those of the Control,
      C75 and C150 groups. The serum IL- 1beta levels in the Ligated group were
      significantly higher than the Control group. The mean osteoblast numbers in the
      Ligated group were lower than those of the Control, C75 and C150 groups. The C150
      groups showed significantly more osteoblasts than the Control group. The
      osteoclast numbers in the Ligated group increased significantly compared to the
      C75, C150 and control groups. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that systemic
      administration of curcumin at the 75 and 150mg/kg doses reduced alveolar bone
      loss in the periodontal disease in rats.

      understand their clinical characteristics, behaviors and treatments. Herein is
      described an incidental collision tumor of HCC-NEC, along with a review of the
      literature focusing on their clinicopathological findings and prognosis. The
      tumor presented here was found incidentally in the hepatectomy specimen of a
      56-year-old man who had undergone liver transplantation for rapidly progressive
      liver failure because of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Imaging and
      laboratory examinations did not demonstrate tumor-related findings. During
      macroscopic examination, two sharply defined and distinctive areas (1.7 cm and
      0.6 cm dimension respectively) were detected among the cirrhotic nodules. The
      characteristic histopathological features and immunohistochemical findings
      allowed a diagnosis of HCC-NEC to be made. There was no evidence of recurrence
      and metastasis after 10 months following surgery. The present case and review
      revealed that these tumors are frequently found in older ages and males. Although
      serum markers are valuable in the discrimination of malignant tumors, their
      absence cannot completely rule out composite HCC-NEC. Diagnosis requires a
      comprehensive histopathological evaluation together with immunohistochemistry.
      The NEC component might influence the treatment strategy and eventually the
      outcome of the patient. In conclusion, the rare occurrence of HCC-NEC and the
      lack of diagnostic clinical signs and symptoms do not exclude their consideration
      in the differential diagnosis of liver tumors, especially in patients with the
      chronic liver disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a multifocal angioproliferative tumor
      involving primarily the skin. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe
      the clinical, demographic, histopathological characteristics, treatment
      modalities, and outcome of 91 KS patients, and compare them with other
      contemporary research. METHODS: Medical records of 91 KS patients followed
      between January 2005 and September 2017 were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: 
      Most of our patients were male (male-to-female ratio was 4.05). The median age at
      diagnosis was 69 years (range, 6-93 years). The duration of the lesions varied
      between 3 and 25 years. The lower extremities were the most commonly involved
      area (51.6%). Of the 91 patients, classic type KS was seen in 75 patients.
      Radiotherapy was used successfully in approximately half of our patients.
      Recurrence was observed in approximately one third of the patients. All KS
      patients in this study except 1 were classic KS. CONCLUSION: The clinical and
      demographic characteristics of our patients were compatible with the previous
      literature suggesting that KS is a tumor that tends to be limited to the skin.
      Close follow-up of patients is important to monitor for recurrence. This is the
      largest report from Turkey to date.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma (SEP) is a plasma cell neoplasm 
      located outside the bone. It is rarely observed in the intracranial area. It is
      very difficult to diagnose this condition radiologically before surgery. In
      addition, dural SEP is usually misdiagnosed. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case
      of plasmacytoma that presented as altered mental status after head trauma,
      located in the subdural area. We also describe its differential diagnosis and
      treatment by total removal and adjuvant radiotherapy. The 66-month follow-up
      findings showed distant plasmacytoma development, which was treated with
      radiotherapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: Some pathological entities should be considered 
      in the differential diagnosis of acute subdural hematomas. Furthermore, to the
      best of our knowledge, we report the first case of dural SEP mimicking acute
      subdural hematoma.

TI  - Pulmonary Metastasectomy of Sarcoma: Is the Ratio of Surgical Margin to Nodule
      Size a Prognostic Factor?
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1670688 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Main prognostic factors of improved survival after pulmonary
      metastasectomy (PM) for osteogenic and soft tissue sarcomas are suggested as
      histological type, number and size of pulmonary nodules, and disease-free
      interval (DFI). METHODS: Sixty-nine patients who underwent PM between January
      1999 and December 2017 were evaluated retrospectively. Relations between
      parameters and prognostic risk factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free
      survival (DFS) were evaluated. RESULTS: Osteosarcoma was the most common
      histologic type (36.2%) and 21 of 25 cases were seen under the age 20 years (p < 
      0.001). Comparison of patient groups including osteosarcoma and nonosteosarcoma
      patients showed significant difference according to age (p < 0.001), nodule size 
      (p = 0.033), ratio of surgical margin to nodule size (p = 0.007), and DFI (p =
      0.039). Univariate analysis showed that the number of nodules (p = 0.008), ratio 
      of surgical margin to nodule size (p = 0.001), and localization of nodule (p =
      0.039) were significant factors associated with DFS. Also, nodule size (p =
      0.042), number of nodules (p = 0.003), ratio of surgical margin to nodule size (p
      < 0.001), and laterality (p = 0.027) were significant prognostic factors
      associated with OS. Cut-off values of ratio of surgical margin to nodule size for
      DFS and OS were calculated as 0.94. Logistic regression analysis determined the
      ratio of surgical margin to nodule size as the common significant risk factor for
      DFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the ratio of surgical margin to
      nodule size >/= 1 should be taken as a common risk factor for DFS and OS.
      Therefore, resection of nodules with the possible widest surgical margin is an
      important point of PM.

TI  - Characterization of Cellulose Synthase A (CESA) Gene Family in Eudicots.
LID - 10.1007/s10528-018-9888-z [doi]
AB  - Cellulose synthase A (CESA) is a key enzyme involved in the complex process of
      plant cell wall biosynthesis, and it remains a productive subject for research.
      We employed systems biology approaches to explore structural diversity of eudicot
      CESAs by exon-intron organization, mode of duplication, synteny, and splice site 
      analyses. Using a combined phylogenetics and comparative genomics approach
      coupled with co-expression networks we reconciled the evolution of cellulose
      synthase gene family in eudicots and found that the basic forms of CESA proteins 
      are retained in angiosperms. Duplications have played an important role in
      expansion of CESA gene family members in eudicots. Co-expression networks showed 
      that primary and secondary cell wall modules are duplicated in eudicots. We also 
      identified 230 simple sequence repeat markers in 103 eudicot CESAs. The 13
      identified conserved motifs in eudicots will provide a basis for gene
      identification and functional characterization in other plants. Furthermore, we
      characterized (in silico) eudicot CESAs against senescence and found that
      expression levels of CESAs decreased during leaf senescence.

AB  - Root metastases of solid organ carcinomas are rare entities. Because of their
      rare occurrence, they can be confused with nerve sheath tumors, such as
      schwannomas or neurofibromas, when detected by magnetic resonance imaging. In
      this paper, we reported a case of a 72-year-old woman with S1 root metastasis
      originating from lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we reviewed the literature and
      presented the diagnosis and treatment stages of this pathology. Surgical
      resection should be the main treatment for symptomatic metastases. Gross total
      resection of tumors is usually not possible with preservation of neurologic
      functions. Nerve root decompression, subtotal resection, and adjuvant treatments 
      seem to represent the best treatment option for these patients.

TI  - Evaluation of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms with a new classification system and
      literature review.
PG  - 533-542

AB  - Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms constitute a diagnostic spectrum ranging from
      adenoma to mucinous adenocarcinoma. To date, many classification systems have
      been proposed to reflect the histomorphological diversity of neoplasms in this
      range and their clinical correspondence, and also to form a common terminology
      between the pathologist and clinicians. The aim of this review is to provide an
      updated perspective on the pathological features of appendiceal mucinous
      neoplasms. Using the 2016 Modified Delphi Consensus Protocol (Delphi) and the
      Eighth Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging
      Manual, 19 cases presented from June 2011 to December 2016 were evaluated and
      diagnosed with appendiceal mucinous neoplasia. According to the Delphi,
      non-carcinoid epithelial tumours of the appendix were categorized in eight
      histomorphological architectural groups. These groups are adenoma, serrated
      polyp, low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm, high-grade appendiceal mucinous
      neoplasm, mucinous adenocarcinoma, poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma with
      signet-ring, signet-ring cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The most common
      symptom was right lower quadrant pain. The median age of these cases was 60+/-15 
      years. There was a preponderance of females (F/M: 15/4). In our re-evaluation,
      six cases were diagnosed as serrated polyp. There were 11 cases in the LAMN group
      and two cases in the mucinous adenocarcinoma group. Using the Delphi and the AJCC
      manual, there were many changes in the classification, evaluation and treatment
      of appendiceal mucinous neoplasms. These classification systems have facilitated 
      the compatibility and communication of clinicians and pathologists and have
      guided clinicians on treatment methods.
