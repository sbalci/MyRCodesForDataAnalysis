### Compare Proportions

```r
prop.test(numerator,denominator)
```


```r
table(impetigo = scabies$impetigo_active, scabies = scabies$scabies_infestation)
# dependent ~ independent
```

```r
#See that because 'no' is the 'base' level the table is laid out
#               No Disease      Has Disease

# Not-exposed

# Exposed

#This is dependent on how your data is coded so you need to check this before using epi.2by2
#If the table is laid out correctly then you can input straight into epi.2by2, otherwise you #need to recode or re-order the variables so that the table will be laid out correctly

#epi.2by2 wants the data with the exposed/disease group in top right corner
#So we just tell R to order the variables differently when we draw the table

epiR::epi.2by2(table(relevel(scabies$scabies_infestation,"yes"), relevel(scabies$impetigo_active,"yes")))
```
