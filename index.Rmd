# Prerequisites

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'bib/packages.bib')
```
