## File organization best practices

This page summarises how to organize files and analysis before everything gets jumbled up:
[Setting up a reproducible data analysis workflow in R](https://andrewbtran.github.io/NICAR/2018/workflow/docs/01-workflow_intro.html)

Basically they suggest:
- using a project and project folder in RStudio for each analysis
- using `packrat` as much as possible

`setwd()` and `getwd()` is not necesary when you use projects.
