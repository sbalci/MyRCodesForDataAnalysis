[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 In short, each string in the vector is split into single char
acters, and the resulting set of characters is replaced by the first character 
in the string. For example, passing c( ._ ) would replace all underscores with 
dots in the column names of both datasets. Similarly, passing c( aA ,  BbCc ) w
ould replace all instances of  A  with  a  and all instances of  b ,  C , or  c
  with  B . This is one way to ignore case for certain letters. Otherwise, it’s
 possible to combine the equivalence classes with ignoring case, by passing (e.
g.) c( ._ ,  case ).[]

 age and sex. Locally at Mayo, the SAS macros %modelsum, %glmuniv, and %logisun

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 One of the most common tables in medical literature includes 
summary statistics for a set of variables, often stratified by some group (e.g.
 treatment arm). Locally at Mayo, the SAS macros %table and %summary were writt
en to create summary tables with a single call. With the increasing interest in
 R, we have developed the function tableby to create similar tables within the 
R environment.[]

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 In developing the tableby() function, the goal was to bring t
he best features of these macros into an R function. However, the task was not 
simply to duplicate all the functionality, but rather to make use of R’s streng
ths (modeling, method dispersion, flexibility in function definition and output
 format) and make a tool that fits the needs of R users. Additionally, the resu
lts needed to fit within the general reproducible research framework so the tab
les could be displayed within an R markdown report.[]

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 The write2*() functions are probably the most useful place to
 take advantage of the magrittr package’s piping framework, since commands are 
often nested several functions deep in the context of write2*(). Piping also al
lows the arsenal package to become a part of more standard analysis pipelines; 
instead of needing to write separate R Markdown programs, intermediate analysis
 tables and output can be easily incorporated into piped statements.[]

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 The only tuning parameter in a random Forests is the argument
 called mtry, which is the number of variables that are selected at each split 
of each tree when you make a split. As seen here, mtry is 4 of the 13 explorato
ry variables (excluding medv) in the Boston Housing data - meaning that each ti
me the tree comes to split a node, 4 variables would be selected at random, the
n the split would be confined to 1 of those 4 variables. That's how randomFores

make a plot using the matplot command. The test error and the out-of-bag error 
are binded together to make a 2-column matrix. There are a few other arguments 
in the matrix, including the plotting character values (pch = 23 means filled d
iamond), colors (red and blue), type equals both (plotting both points and conn
ecting them with the lines), and name of y-axis (Mean Squared Error). You can a

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Ideally, these 2 curves should line up, but it seems like the
 test error is a bit lower. However, there's a lot of variability in these test
 error estimates. Since the out-of-bag error estimate was computed on one datas
et and the test error estimate was computed on another dataset, these differenc
es are pretty much well within the standard errors.[] 
 []

[359]
Overfull \hbox (1676.25pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 9451--9451
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Notice that the red curve is smoothly above the blue curve? T
hese error estimates are very correlated, because the randomForest with mtry = 
4 is very similar to the one with mtry = 5. That's why each of the curves is qu
ite smooth. What you see is that mtry around 4 seems to be the most optimal cho
ice, at least for the test error. This value of mtry for the out-of-bag error e
quals 9.[]

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 So with very few tiers, you have fitted a very powerful predi
ction model using random forests. How so? The left-hand side shows the performa
nce of a single tree. The mean squared error on out-of-bag is 26, and you've dr
opped down to about 15 (just a bit above half). This means you reduced the erro
r by half. Likewise for the test error, you reduced the error from 20 to 12.[]

'll be doing squared error loss. You're going to ask GBM for 10,000 trees, whic
h sounds like a lot, but these are going to be shallow trees. Interaction depth
 is the number of splits, so you want 4 splits in each tree. Shrinkage is 0.01,
 which is how much you're going to shrink the tree step back.[]

 are powerful methods that you can use anytime as needed. In my experience, boo
sting usually outperforms RandomForest, but RandomForest is easier to implement
. In RandomForest, the only tuning parameter is the number of trees; while in b
