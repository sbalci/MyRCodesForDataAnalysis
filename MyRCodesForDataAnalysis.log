Overfull \hbox (2407.86pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 5058--5058
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 In short, each string in the vector is split into single char
acters, and the resulting set of characters is replaced by the first character 
in the string. For example, passing c("._") would replace all underscores with 
dots in the column names of both datasets. Similarly, passing c("aA", "BbCc") w
ould replace all instances of "A" with "a" and all instances of "b", "C", or "c
" with "B". This is one way to ignore case for certain letters. Otherwise, it’s
 possible to combine the equivalence classes with ignoring case, by passing (e.
g.) c("._", "case").[]

ken as a two-dimensional contingency table: the entries of x must be non-negati
ve integers. Otherwise, x and y must be vectors or factors of the same length; 
cases with missing values are removed, the objects are coerced to factors, and 
the contingency table is computed from these. Then Pearson's chi-squared test i
s performed of the null hypothesis that the joint distribution of the cell coun

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Seems like the correct classifications dropped a little bit. 
It has done about the same as your original tree, so pruning did not hurt much 
with respect to misclassification errors, and gave a simpler tree.[]

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Often case, trees don't give very good prediction errors, so 
let's go ahead take a look at random forests and boosting, which tend to outper
form trees as far as prediction and misclassification are concerned.[]

e random forests and boosting. The dataset is located in the MASS package. It g
ives housing values and other statistics in each of 506 suburbs of Boston based
 on a 1970 census.[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (55.86pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063

 []


Overfull \hbox (1184.61pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 In this dataset, there are 506 surburbs of Boston. For each s
urburb, you have variables such as crime per capita, types of industry, average
 # of rooms per dwelling, average proportion of age of the houses etc. Let's us
e medv - the median value of owner-occupied homes for each of these surburbs, a
s the response variable.[] 
 []

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Let's fit a random forest and see how well it performs. As be

 and the training sample set.[] 
 []

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Printing out the random forest gives its summary: the # of tr
ees (500 were grown), the mean squared residuals (MSR), and the percentage of v
ariance explained. The MSR and % variance explained are based on the out-of-bag
 estimates, a very clever device in random forests to get honest error estimate
s.[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (2029.86pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 The only tuning parameter in a random Forests is the argument
 called mtry, which is the number of variables that are selected at each split 
of each tree when you make a split. As seen here, mtry is 4 of the 13 explorato
ry variables (excluding medv) in the Boston Housing data - meaning that each ti
me the tree comes to split a node, 4 variables would be selected at random, the
n the split would be confined to 1 of those 4 variables. That's how randomFores
ts de-correlates the trees.[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (71.61pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 You're going to fit a series of random forests. There are 13

 []

[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 In a loop of mtry from 1 to 13, you first fit the randomFores
t with that value of mtry on the train dataset, restricting the number of trees

Overfull \hbox (24.36pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Lastly, you compute the test error: mean-squared error, which
 is equals to mean( (medv - pred) ^ 2 ).[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (2166.36pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Basically you just grew 4550 trees (13 times 350). Now let's 
make a plot using the matplot command. The test error and the out-of-bag error 
are binded together to make a 2-column matrix. There are a few other arguments 
in the matrix, including the plotting character values (pch = 23 means filled d
iamond), colors (red and blue), type equals both (plotting both points and conn
ecting them with the lines), and name of y-axis (Mean Squared Error). You can a
lso put a legend at the top right corner of the plot.[]

 []


Overfull \hbox (1326.36pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Ideally, these 2 curves should line up, but it seems like the
 test error is a bit lower. However, there's a lot of variability in these test
 error estimates. Since the out-of-bag error estimate was computed on one datas
et and the test error estimate was computed on another dataset, these differenc
es are pretty much well within the standard errors.[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (1515.36pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 Notice that the red curve is smoothly above the blue curve? T
hese error estimates are very correlated, because the randomForest with mtry = 
4 is very similar to the one with mtry = 5. That's why each of the curves is qu
ite smooth. What you see is that mtry around 4 seems to be the most optimal cho
ice, at least for the test error. This value of mtry for the out-of-bag error e
quals 9.[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (1457.61pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 So with very few tiers, you have fitted a very powerful predi
ction model using random forests. How so? The left-hand side shows the performa
nce of a single tree. The mean squared error on out-of-bag is 26, and you've dr
opped down to about 15 (just a bit above half). This means you reduced the erro
r by half. Likewise for the test error, you reduced the error from 20 to 12.[]

 []


Overfull \hbox (1378.86pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 7063--7063
[]\TU/lmtt/m/n/10 GBM asks for the distribution, which is Gaussian, because you
'll be doing squared error loss. You're going to ask GBM for 10,000 trees, whic
h sounds like a lot, but these are going to be shallow trees. Interaction depth
 is the number of splits, so you want 4 splits in each tree. Shrinkage is 0.01,
 which is how much you're going to shrink the tree step back.[]

 are powerful methods that you can use anytime as needed. In my experience, boo
sting usually outperforms RandomForest, but RandomForest is easier to implement
. In RandomForest, the only tuning parameter is the number of trees; while in b
oosting, more tuning parameters are required besides the number of trees, inclu
