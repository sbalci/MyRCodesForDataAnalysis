Several packages support making beautiful tables with R, such as

* [xtable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/)
* [stargazer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/)
* [pander](http://rapporter.github.io/pander/)
* [tables](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tables/)
* [ascii](http://eusebe.github.io/ascii/)
* etc.

It is also very easy to make tables with knitr's `kable` function:


```r
knitr::kable(head(iris), caption = "Title of the table")

```


<!--```r -->
<!-- tables::knit_print.tabular(mtcars) -->
<!--```-->




```r
pander::pander(mtcars)
```



```r
stargazer::stargazer(mtcars)
```




```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5, ], caption = "A knitr kable.")
```


```r
library(rhandsontable)
rhandsontable(mtcars)
```


```r
xtable::xtable(mtcars)
```
