In this repository I am going to collect `R codes` for data analysis. The title says "My R Codes" but I am only the collector. I will try to refer the original sources as far as I can.
[Serdar Balci, MD, Pathologist](https://www.serdarbalci.com/)


**My aim** is to collect all the codes one needs, where one starts with an excel or spss file and then end with the most common analysis used in histopathology papers : _[example table](https://media.nature.com/original/nature-assets/modpathol/journal/v31/n1/extref/modpathol2017106x4.docx)_

There are plenty of ways to do an analysis in `R`, which is great but also confusing for the newbies. I will collect the codes here so that I can refer later and then update them as I learn more.


**See the Codes here:**

See https://sbalci.github.io/MyRCodesForDataAnalysis/ for R codes I am collecting.
