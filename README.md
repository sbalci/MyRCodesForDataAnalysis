# My R Codes For Data Analysis

In this repository I am going to collect `R codes` for data analysis. The title says "My R Codes" but I am only the collector. I will try to refer the original sources as far as I can.

**My aim** is to collect all the codes one needs, where one starts with an excel or spss file and then end with the most common analysis used in histopathology papers : _[example table](https://media.nature.com/original/nature-assets/modpathol/journal/v31/n1/extref/modpathol2017106x4.docx)_


**See the Codes here:**
